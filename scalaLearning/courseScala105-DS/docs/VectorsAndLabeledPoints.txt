Vectors MLlib's local vectors:
    - are used as org.apache.spark.mllib.linalg.{Vector, Vectors}
    -Index are 0-based integers used and values are doubles
    -Local vectores ares stored on a single machine
    -Can be dense or sparse

Dense Vector:
    -Backed by a double array containing its valued
    -Is the "obvious" implementation
    -Can be created from an array of doubles

Sparse Vector:
    -Is backed by two arrays:
        -A integer array represanting the indexes
        -A double array containing the values
    -Is a binary-search implementation

    -Can be created by:
        -Two separate arrays
        -A sequence of tuples

    -Must begin sepecifying the total size of the vector

Labeled Points:
    -Association of a vector, either dense or sparse, with corresponding label/response
    -Used in supervised machine learning algorithms
    -Labels are stored as doubles so they can be used in both regression and classification problems
    -In classification labels must be:
        - 0(negative), 1(positive)
        -class start from zero (0,1,2...) for multiclass
