Sampling
    -Can be performed on any RDD
    -Return a sampled subset of an RDD
    -With or Without replacement
    -Fraction
        -Without replacement -expected size of the sample as fraction of RDD's size
        -With replacement -expected number of times each element is chosen
    
Random Sampling
    -Receives the weights to split the samples
    -The output is an aproximate count of the percentage submited on the weights

Stratified Sampling
    -Can be performed on RDDs of key-value pairs
    -Think of keys as labels and values as an specific attribute
    -Can be performed by two ways:
        -sampleByKey:
            Requires only one pass over the data and provides an exected sample size
        -sampleByKeyExact:
            Provides the exact sampling size with 99.99% confidence but requires
                significantly more resources
