Hypothesis Test:
    -Used to determine whether a result is statistically significant, that is,
        whether it occurred by chance or not
    -Can be an input of RDD[LabeledPoint] enabling feature selection
    
    -Supported tests:

        -Chi-Squared for goodness of fit:
            -Determines whether an observed frequency distribution differs from a given distribution or not
            -Requires an input of type Vector containing the frequencies of the events
            -It runs against a uniform distribution, if a second vector to test against is not supplied
            -Available as 'chiSqTest()' function in Statistics module

        -Chi-Squared for independence
            -Determines whether unpaired observations on two variables are independent of each other
            -Requires an input of type Matrix, representing a contingency table or an RDD[LabeledPoint]
            -May be used for feature Selection

        -Kolmogorov-Smirnov for equality of distribution
            -Determines whether or not two probability distributions are equal
            -One sample, two sided test
            -Supported distributions to test against
            -Normal distribution (distName='norm')
            -customized cumulative density function (CDF)
            -Available as kolmogorovSmirnovTest() in Statistics

        -Kernel Density Estimation
            -Compute an estimate of the probability density function of a random variable
            -Does not require assumptions about the particular distribution
            -Requires an RDD of samples
            -Abailable as estimate() in KernelDensity
            -In Spark only Gaussian kernel is Supported
