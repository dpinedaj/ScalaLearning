All collection classes are found in the package scala.collection or one of its sub-packages

---> scala.collections.immutable
    -> Is guaranteed to be immutable for everyone. Such a collection will never change after is created
        so you can rely on the fact that acessing the same collection value repeatedly at different
        points in time will always yield a collection with the same elements
---> scala.collections.mutable
    ->Have somera operations that change the collection in place. So is needed to understand his methods

By default scala always pick immutable collections. for example if you just write Set, it will be immutable
    the mutable set is called collection.mutable.Set or import it by convention "import scala.collection.mutable"


Every kind of collectino can be created with the same uniform syntax: write the colleciton class name followed by its elements:

>>>Traversable(1, 2, 3)
>>>Iterable("x", "y", "z")
>>>Map("x" -> 24, "y" -> 25, "z" -> 26)
>>>Set(Color.red, Color.green, Color.blue)
>>>SortedSet("hello", "world")
>>>Buffer(x, y, z)
>>>IndexedSeq(1.0, 2.0)
>>>LinearSeq(a, b, c)

>>>List(1, 2, 3)
>>>HashMap("x" -> 24, "y" -> 25, "z" -> 26)
