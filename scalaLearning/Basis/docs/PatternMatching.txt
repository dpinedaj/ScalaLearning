Patter matching:
    -Mainly concept of switch/case
    -Pattern matching can be applied across many different types of data
    -Can be embedded within other expressions as a way of cleanly expressing conditional logic

Match:
    You can match on many different kind of values:
        -Literal values like "12:00"
        -Use guard conditions to be more specific
        -Match on only some parts of a value
        -More specific cases must come first, more general last
        -Id you use the _ or a simple name with no type, both match on everything
    When you see the **case** keyword, pattern matching is in play
    -Case classes and ADTs provide compile-time exhaustiveness checking that all possible
        conditions have been have been met
