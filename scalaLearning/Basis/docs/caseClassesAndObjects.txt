What is a Data Class?
    -A class that represent specific data types in a "domain"
    i.e.
    An online store needs:
        -Customers
        -Accounts
        -Orders
        -Inventory

What is a Service Class?
    -Some classes represent work to be performed in an application
    -They know what to do, but they don't have data themselves
    -When an application calls the service, then pass the data to the
        service, and the service transforms it in some way

    i.e.
        -Persistence
        -Loggers
        -Calculation engines

What is a Case Class:
    -A representation of a data type that removes a lot of
     boilerplate code
        -Generates JVM-specific convenience methods
        -Makes every class parameter a field
        -Is immutable by default
        -Performs value-based equivalence by default

    -Instead of comparing one instance of a case class 
    to another to see if they are the same isntance you're
    actually checking the values inside of them to make sure
    that this is value equivalent to another instance
    of case class here

What is a Case Object:
    -A representation of a data type of which there can only be a single instance
    -If you try to create a case class with no parameters, it is stateless and should be
    a case object
