Apply method:
    Apply method is an special method that allows to call it just with an () in the instance.
        i.e.
        >>>object Reverse {
            def apply(s: String): String = s.reverse
        }
        >>>Reverse("Hello")
        res0: String = olleH

    A good example for this method is as we call an Array():
        i.e.
        >>>val arr = Array(1, 2, 3)
        >>>arr(1)  //Here we are using the method apply asking for the value in the index 1
        res0: Int = 2


Unapply method:
    It can deconstruct a case class
    i.e.
    >>>case class Time(hours: Int=0, minutes: Int=0)
    >>>val time = Time(9, 0)
    >>>Time.unapply(time)
    res0: Option[(Int, Int)] = Some((9, 0))
