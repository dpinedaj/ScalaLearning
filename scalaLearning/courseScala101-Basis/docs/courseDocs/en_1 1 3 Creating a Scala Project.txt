welcome to creating a scallop project after completing this lesson we should
be able to describe how to create a new scallop project outline how to add
external libraries such spark to your project and then open the project inside
of Scala IDE to create a new scallop project created directory somewhere on
your disk at that point you're going to want to edit a new file called a
build-out SPT inside of that fire you only need three things first of all the
version of scholar you want to use
the name of the project and finally any dependencies that I may want to add to
my project such as libraries that may come from other people who created them
that you want to leverage inside of your project to do that we add the library
dependencies we give the groupId of who created the project that we want to use
the name of the project we want to pull in the Persian scholar with which it is
being used and then finally the version of the project itself that we are going
to be leveraging once we have these three things we have the basis of an
entire project in Scala and now I type activator to start my activator session
inside of this project and instead of bringing up the WebUI as we saw earlier
because it knows it's inside of an SBT project it will start a build session
inside of that project when you receive your prompt which is this carrot right
here you can now start typing in commands Command Sgt or commands such as
compile to compile all of the source inside of the project you can also run
the test command which will run any tests that you have inside of your
project or run if you have any classes that start up a JVM and an application
in this case we don't have any source yet so there's nothing to run in order
to open her project in Scala IDE first we have to make sure that we have the
Eclipse plugin added to our activator project to do that we have to leave
activator and I find the best way to leave activator is to use control D
once you're back at the root of the project you want to move into the
project folder which was created for you when you created this project and ran
activator so CD into project folder and now you want to create a plugins . SBT
file inside of this file you're going to want to add a single line you want to
say add SPT plugin where you add the group com type saved at SBT clips and
then the project SPT like Eclipse plugin and the version 3200 as it currently
stands once you've done this save the file
return to the temp project folder and then type activator again this will
reload the entire context of all of the information about this project including
what you just add it now if you type eclipse the command line inside of the
SBT prompt it's going to create the Eclipse project files for you so that
you can open this project inside Eclipse if you use IntelliJ IntelliJ has the
ability to read your build-down SBT file and you don't need to do this step 2
downloads khallid go to Scala dash I D dot org
where you'll find the latest links to download the latest version of the idea
itself once you've done that and you have the ideal local on your box you can
start the I D which will load eclipse with the Scala IDE plugin as well this
may take a few minutes but once it's up and running you don't have to add your
project to the Package Explorer inside of Eclipse now even though this is a
brand new project we've already created it inside of our shells session and we
need to import an existing project into Eclipse to do that we need to right
click inside the Package Explorer or go to the file
and select Import once we done that this dialogue should show up asking us what
kind of project we want to import we want to say in the general group that we
want to bring in an existing project into our current workspace we say next
and then we have to select the location of our temp project that we were using
in my case it's going to be on my desktop and select the term project I
see open and I should see my projects view and side of eclipse the simple
Scala project that I created when I say finish eclipse is going to bring it into
the Eclipse context and now whenever expand it I'll see that there's a whole
bunch of stuff here that was created for me
such as the location for our I want to put my Scala source files any Java
source files any resource files such as configuration and we might be using then
we also have locations for our test source files as well if I want to create
a class I merely right click on the source main Scala and I say new and
select scholar class and I can call that anything I want for example through and
then the class will be created underneath that grouping
