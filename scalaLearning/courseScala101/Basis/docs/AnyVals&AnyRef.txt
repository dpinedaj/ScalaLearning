In scala everything is an object
- Any is the super type of all types, also called the top type.
    It defines certain universal methods such as equals, hashCode, and toString,
    Any has two direct subclasses: AnyVal and AnyRef

- AnyVal represents the value types:
    -Integer, Long, Double, Float, Boolean, Char, Byte, Unit

-AnyRef represents reference types. All non-value types are defined as referece types
    Every user-defined type in Scala is a subtype of AnyRef, the predefined are:
    -String, Iterable, Seq, List, Arrays.....


Everything is Nothing....
