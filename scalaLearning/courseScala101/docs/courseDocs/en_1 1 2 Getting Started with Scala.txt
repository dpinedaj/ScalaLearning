welcome to getting started with Scala after completing this lesson you should
be able to describe how to get started with Scala on your machine and outline
how to start a new project in Scala Scala language has a website called
Scotland dash lang DAW tour with the beautiful picture of Lausanne
Switzerland to get started with the language click on the download link on
the front page which will give you the option of how you want to bring the
language down to your machine you can download the language itself which will
give you the compiler and tooling around how to get started with the project or
you can download types of activator a tool which is very good for helping you
start with templates that show you how to do specific things with Scala what
I've downloaded types of activator I have to decompress the zip file has been
brought down in this case I put it on my desktop if I open the folder that was
from the compressed zip file you'll see you have a folder inside of their called
activator with scripts inside of allowing you to run activator on various
platforms if you were running on Mac OS X or Linux use the activator shell
script if you're running on Windows based platforms use activator batch file
I start the activator script and it starts at Shell session which is going
to figure out whether it has the most recent version of activator and then
start a web UI there are many templates inside of activated allow you to get
started with various parts of the skull ecosystem if you want to just start
learning scholar you can select hello Scala template other templates include
various parts of the ecosystem such as the concurrency toolkit the play web
framework and spark for big data handling we also have seeds were you
have a project starting point without any functionality already built into it
if I look at the tutorials and I searched on spark a bunch of templates
show up I'm going to select the spark workshop template I want to
choose where on my desk this template will live in this case I will put in my
desktop in the activator folder choose and then I press the Create button at
this point all of the dependencies this project requires will be brought down
from various repositories across the internet
there could be quite a few in this may take some time however it's a one-time
cost you do it the first time and after that in immediately loads when you open
the template you'll see a new user interface which allows you to explore a
tutorial about this project it also has a view to allow you to see the code
compile the code executes the tests associated with this project and run the
application if that's part of this template the spark workshop template
will explain to you what patchy spark is how it's used in Hadoop context and has
several examples that are considered canonical in the Big Data space such as
word count if we navigate through the tutorial you will see that we eventually
reach a point where we are describing the various implementations of these
applications so here is an example code word count to word count being the kind
of application where you're counting the number of times the word is used in all
of Shakespeare's great works this is a very simple application it's not that
large the comments themselves make up for more of the source code then the
logic itself and you can also execute the tests so that one by one the various
parts of the project can be executed to be sure that they're implemented
correctly we look at the code again we can move on to the other projects such
as word count three the matrix for the crawl which is the fifth application in
spark the inverted index and and grams which is natural language processing
when you're finished using activated to get started you can bring the source
code down to your machine locally
clicking on this button right here which will allow you to open the project and
the IntelliJ IDEA IDE or the Eclipse IDE or I down to your file system so that
you can use it with Sublime Text Emacs VMware any other editor you prefer after
having completed this lesson we should understand and be able to describe how
to get started with Scala as well as be able to use activator to get started
quickly with templates and seed projects
