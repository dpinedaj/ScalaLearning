Why Scala for Data Science?
    -All of the data science capabilities expect:
        -Centrality and dispersion measures
        -Normalization and standarization
        -Covariance and correlation
        -Receiver operating characteristics (ROC) curve
        -Feature engineering
        -Random Forest
        -Support vector machines(SVM)
