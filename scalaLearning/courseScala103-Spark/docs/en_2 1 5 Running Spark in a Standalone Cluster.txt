welcome to running spark in a stand-alone cluster after completing
this lesson you should be able to describe sparks various deployment
options and discuss the role resource negotiators play in deciding what work
is performed on which physical resources spark has several resource management
options and up until this point during this module we've been running
everything locally on the box on which I've been performing this work however
we also have stand-alone mode where spark itself can be responsible for
giving work across a cluster of machines spark also has the capability to
leverage external resource negotiators such as may Sosa Jorge dupes yarn
resource negotiator is also the standalone mode which works on Amazon's
ec2 and databases such as Cassandra react and other databases also have
their own modes for direct interaction with spark sparks main has a driver
which is responsible for creating the spark context and then dealing with the
data in some meaningful way in this example is streaming context that driver
then gives its information to the Cluster Manager and the Cluster Manager
dictates how work is distributed across the various nodes that make up the
partition data and where the work will take place in local mode we just have a
single JBM process to run and it's doing the work of the driver and the executor
and all the tasks but sparks stand-alone cluster is the simplest way to start
using more physical or logical nodes within a cluster in spark it does not
require an outside resource negotiator to determine what works should be run on
which physical machine or virtual node with sparks standalone mode we manually
configure our server instances and the spark master instance is the Cluster
Manager jobs run in a queue like way where you use first in first out
semantics and includes stops scripts for conveniens
to start the spark master we designate the spark home and then we use this
start master shell script we can then log the information is running on this
individual node using a master URL in the spark stand-alone cluster world we
have master and slave nodes and on each slave node we then start the slave using
the start slave shell script we designate the master by saying the
location of the master host and port on which you can be connected to having
