welcome to data frame data sources to after completing this lesson you should
be able to discuss how to add support for a new data source we mentioned in
the previous lesson that you can add other data sources than the ones that
come to you from spark out of the box we're going to add the spark
comma-separated values package that is created by data bricks which can be
found here you go to get have dot com and go to the data bricks namespace
you'll find the repository for spark dash csd you could also find spark CSV
at spark dash packages dot org
which is a community index of packages for spark within a dependency to the
project build file for applications if we are trying to add the dependency in a
spark rubble session we can do so using the packages flag when we create the
rebel in this example we are going to take an existing spark project and add
the spark CSV dependency to it you have to work inside of a build file and if
you are using SBT you add the group name comdata breaks the artifactId spark CSV
and then the version that you want
one-dot 320 in this case and you can specify optionally that you want the
sources versions of you can see the source code if need be we are going to
read in a group of airport information in this case you'll see the top line
includes a header header describes each one of the columns inside of the CSV
file
the first column is the IATA acronym for the airport and then the airport named
the city the state the country and the latitude and longitude of that airport
when we look at the source code for this application where we're pulling in the
new data source will once again create our spark configuration and we run in
local mode calling this application spark data frames were going to run with
four partitions once again and then we're going to create our spark context
using the configuration and create the sequel context from that spark on
text when we read in the data from the comma separated values file we specify
the name of the file that we wanted the end and give it any options that we want
from beforehand for example the format is listed as CSV and we say whether or
not there's a header at the beginning of the file and whether or not to infer the
schema we then print out the scheme I we show it and we stopped the spark context
when we run this application we see that the data frame with CSV file is going to
be run and then you see the schema of the comma separated values being shown
when the data is displayed it shows it in a meaningful way that is pretty
printed so you can see the IATA acronym the airport the city the state the
country in the latitude and longitude clearly the show will only show the top
20 rows unless you specify otherwise
having completed this lesson you should be able to discuss how to add support
for a new data source in spark
