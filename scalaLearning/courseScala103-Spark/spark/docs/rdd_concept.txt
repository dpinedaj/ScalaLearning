-Resiliant Distributed Dataset
    ->Is just another collection in the scala collections library
        are immutable at its core assuring thread safety
    ->They're distributed in partitions, in different nodes
        of the cluster
    ->Each step of a dataflow that transforms an RDD results in
        a new RDD being created
    ->RDDs are "lazy"
        -A DAG of computation is constructed, where looping 
            is not possible within it
        -The actual data is processed only when results are
            requested

        -They know their "parents" and transitively, all of their
            "ancestors" in the lineage of the data flow
        -RDDs are resilient, and a lost partition can be reconstructed from its
            lineage
