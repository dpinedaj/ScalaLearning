a : there are lots of things that can label items factory refurbished . some are so frivolous , its laughable . but because consumer laws prevent manufacturers from selling anything considered factory refurbished as " new " , the second consumer gets the best deal . here are a few examples : manufacturers / distributors are not allowed to export outside their territory / country . to avoid " disturbing " the dealer / reseller channel in different countries , manufacturers and distributors cannot export the product , as new and therefore label it as refurb . most major retail superstores offer a 30 - day money back guarantee on their products and there are those consumers that just simply take advantage of that . these items are returned to the manufacturer , inspected and repackaged like new . items where the box or casing was damaged in shipment , which are returned to the manufacturer . the item was returned to the manufacturer because of a slight defect . the part that was defective was replaced by the manufacturer , tested and then repackaged just like new . the item was returned because of a minor cosmetic blemish on the casing that was corrected . demonstration units are also considered factory refurbished . these units are inspected , tested and repackaged . the box was simply opened . thats it ! brand new overstocked items are also labeled factory refurbished . all factory refurbished products are inspected serviced by the manufacturer then tested and repackaged to meet original product specifications . all merchandise is warranted by the original manufacturer . your one stop distributorjebel ali duty free zonedubai , uae . www . computron - me . com for latest clearance sale listing contact our sales department . for further details please send your enquiries to : dealers @ emirates . net . aeor contact via www . computron - me . com compaq hewlett packard 3 com dell intel iomega epson aopen creative toshiba apc cisco us robotics microsoft canon intellinet targus viewsonic ibm sony - - - - - - - and lots more ! ! ! if you have any complaints / suggestions contact : customerservice @ computron - me . com tel + 971 4 8834464 all prices in u . s . dollars , ex - works , jebel ali duty free zone fax + 971 4 8834454 www . computron - me . com prices and availability subject to change without notice . usa - canada u . a . e . to receive our special offers in plain text format reply to this mail with the request * for export only * this email can not be considered spam as long as we include : contact information remove instructions . this message is intended for dealer and resellers only . if you have somehow gotten on this list in error , or for any other reason would like to be removed , please reply with " remove " in the subject line of your message . this message is being sent to you in compliance with the federal legislation for commercial e - mail ( h . r . 4176 - section 101 paragraph ( e ) ( 1 ) ( a ) and bill s . 1618 title iii passed by the 105 th u . s . congress . all logos and trademarks are the property of their respective owners products may not be exactly as shown above - - to unsubscribe from : computron 7 , just follow this link : click the link , or copy and paste the address into your browser .)

(0977.2004-04-30.GP.spam.txt,Subject: reply soon ! ! ! dear sir , i know this email will reach you as a surprise , but need not to worry as we are using the only secured and confidential medium available to seekfor foreign assistance in a business . it is with heartfelt hope that i write to seek your co - operation and assistance in the context stated below : may i first introduce my self : i am dr . ( mrs . ) mariam abacha , the wife of late general sani abacha ( former military head of state and president of the federal republic of nigeria ) who died suddenly on 8 th june 1998 . i got your contact on the internet as i was making contact for a honest foreigner who will help save my life and my children , hence our country has been frustrating us since the death of my husband . i have lost confidence with anybody within the country . having noted the confidence reposed on your person , i became convinced of your capability and goodwill to assist me in receiving the sum of us $ 20 million secretly willed in my favour by the late general ( my husband ) . this money was kept in a security company in amsterdam holland and i have all documents with me as of when it was deposited in a security vault for safe keeping . this money has been defaced for security reasons and also to avoid it been spent by unauthorized persons . it is not an ill gotten wealth rather , it was generated from my organisation family support program ( f . s . p ) . i will enlighten you more of this organisation if you indicate a helping interest to secure this money on my behalf . on your acceptance to render this assistance to me to invest this fund abroad in a confidential manner until we came to a conclusion to use it to buy houses and part of it will be used for non - speculative investments in your country . however , the current civilian administration of retired general olusegun obasanjo ( the president of the federal republic of nigeria ) is seeking vengeance on the abacha family because of the life prison jail sentence confirmed on him by my late husband while in office . in pursuit of this vendetta , the present government have resolved to freeze all known assets of general sani abacha including properties at home and abroad and are presently embarking on to seize the various bank accounts of my husband in swizerland , uk , australia . in fact , the attack on our family ( the abacha ' s ) is so devastated to an extent of seizing our travelling passport , family accounts and even trying some members of our family in court for offences allegedly committed by my late husband . in view of this grevious threat to our economic and personal survival , our family trustee have secretly protected the will , the security company has called me to do something about claiming this consignment because of the demurrage it is incurring and i told them we would come and claim it very soon . but my son seriously advised me to move the fund into an overseas amount , hence the reason why i have chosen you and hope that you will come to my full assistance and unlimited co - operation . in the meantime , there is a travelling embargo on us ( the whole family members ) and our local accounts are seized . we are currently living on goodwill of people who believe we cannot be held responsible for the sins of my late husband . in view of this plight , i expect you to be trustworthy and kind enough to respond to this distressed call to save me and my children from a hopeless future . and if you agree to help , we will compensate you sincerely for your candid effort in this regard with 25 % of the total amount of $ 20 million us dollars . in that case , when the money ( $ 20 million ) is moved into your discrete account , you will be allowed to withdraw 25 % in your favour , while 10 % has been set aside for any expenses you might incur ( there are demurrage to pay before the consignment is sign and claimed by you . ) during the process of securing this consignment . the remaining 65 % will be invested meaningfully for my children ' s future . my cousin ( dr . yemi musa ) has perfected arrangements with the trust company concerned and has been assured 100 % risk free and safe operation . what i demand from you now is to arrange to visit the finance company where this money is being deposited and claim it as the bona - fide owner . and in due course , all contacts must be made through dr yemi musa through this e - mail : address yemimusa 2 @ hotvoice . com and phone : 00221 512 48 59 . senegal . i look forward to your quick response while thanking you for your co - operation . in view of all above details , i request you to keep this letter and co - operation highly confidential . best wishes , mrs . mariam abacha .)

( otcbb : ) . ldgkcpf dear shareholder , addlrko i am writing to you today to discuss the new direction which your company will be heading . up until this point we made it clear that abdv would be open to opportunities in all sectors of the market . our basic premise was to seek out companies that can be turned into positive cash flow businesses with the proper equity investment made into them by abdv . fine wein records is an example of that ; with a financial commitment of $ 250 , 000 by abdv we expect fine wein to be able to throw off significant positive cash flow over the next 12 months from the various projects they are currently working on . e - direct is another example ; we should start to see some meaningful positive cash flow developing and continuing over the next 12 months . however , abdv has not maintained a particular industry focus . as of today that has changed . wmlgoioalpyxoduccgfir last week we announced that abdv will be providing $ 1 , 000 , 000 in equity financing to future quest , inc . ( pink sheets : ) , a company in the oil gas sector , this was the start of our new direction . abdv will be dedicated in locating and provide managerial , accounting and financing for companies in the energy field , from oil and gas companies to alternative energy companies . jxyjbcwuomrbaypipswft you may ask ; why the energy related field ? simply it currently offers many opportunities and with the price of oil approaching $ 50 per a barrel we believe there is a lot of wealth to be made in this sector . according to adjusted inflated dollars oil has not yet hit its all time peak of $ 73 from the 1970 s . however , unlike the oil crisis of the past , we are looking at what will be a problem to stay with us for a long time . simply put the demand for oil world wide has increased by some 2 . 5 % this year alone , most of which is because of china . the increase in oil prices is not a fade which once the bubble bursts will result in oil back in the $ 20 - 30 level . we are looking at a trend that is now cemented in stone . there are more players in the world economy today that require oil gas to propel their own economies and this fact alone will keep oil prices at these higher levels . abdv has already aligned itself with individuals that have experience in the energy field . these individuals will help locate viable opportunities and the funding necessary to participate in these opportunities . wtxrxayfisoira so what do we do with our non - energy related businesses such as fine wein records and e - direct ? well , first of all we will continue to incubate and nurture these businesses until they are at a level where they can move on their own . i believe that both of these companies will be strong viable businesses in 12 months from now . at that point i will recommend to abdv ' s board of directors that we spin - off these two businesses to our shareholders . this strategy is in keeping with the basic premise of our business module whereby we share the wealth directly with our shareholders by bringing public our portfolio companies . we can then continue to concentrate in the energy - related field . lvxhkmblmcewrw by concentrating on a specific sector such as the energy area we will be able to define abdv ' s purpose and guide it like a laser . our goal will be to locate and make investments in no less than four energy - related businesses over the next 12 months . i believe that by maintaining this focus an investment in abdv will be looked at as an innovative way to participate in the booming oil gas and energy - related fields . twqssqlqqkvbdm fine wein records , inc . announces compilation music deal for theworld - renowned ` i love ny ' logo fine wein records , inc . , a subsidiary of atlantis business development corporation , inc .

( ndin ) announced today it has entered into a letter of intent to provide an exclusive license to its voip products with lmb technologies inc . for the caribbean market which includes bermuda . the terms of the letter of intent include a 20 % royalty payable to nomad of the gross revenue generated by lmb technologies inc . of any sales and other revenue generated from the license . additional consideration payable to nomad includes 20 % of the common stock of lmb technologies inc . which will seek a public listing of its common shares in the u . s market as soon as practicably possible . the acquisition of the license is subject to the parties entering into a definitive agreement and to both the due diligence and board approvals of lmb technologies inc . and nomad international inc . pursuant to the proposed acquisition , on closing , lmb technologies inc . would pay 2 o % of its common stock to nomad international inc . as consideration payable for the license and would agree to pay 20 % of the gross revenues generated from any activities related to the license exclusive to the caribbean market . !

( , stated jan olivier , ceo and chairman of nomad international inc . may 18 - nomad international inc . ( ndin ) commented today on the recent announcement by the canadian radio - television and telecommunications commission ( crtc ) that they would regulate voice over internet protocol ( voip ) service only when it is provided and used as local telephone service . in its decision , the crtc determined that in an effort to build sustainable competition in local telephone markets , the incumbent carriers will not be permitted to price their local voip services below cost to stifle competition . the ruling is a very positive one for nomad in our efforts to enter the canadian market with our products via internet service providers , cable companies and virtual operators . the ruling permits us to enter the market with a competitive framework , stated jan oliver , ceo of nomad international inc . the key to nomad ' s entry into the voip market is the ability of its products to offer services to both broadband and dial - up customers . though broadband is gaining more and more acceptance and utilization worldwide , dial - up remains the primary source of internet connectivity . in the u . s . alone , there are over 20 o , ooo , 0 oo users of the internet . of the total users in the u . s . , the total number of users of broadband is only approximately 40 , oo 0 , 000 ; ( stats by the yankee group ) dial - up therefore represents approximately 8 o % of the entire internet connectivity market . the percentage of dial - up versus broadband users worldwide is even higher . nomad ' s ability to offer voip products to dial - up customers and service providers not only offers significant potential for market penetration , but also sets the company apart from its competition in the marketplace by offering a unique , proprietary and easily adaptable product . about nomad international inc . nomad international inc . is a multi - national internet communications company developing cost effective telecommunications through voice over internet protocol ( voip ) technologies . the company ' s revolutionary voip product line called nomad systems that has dial - up , broadband , dsl , cable , satellite and wireless capabilities . the company plans on targeting : 1 ) national fixed line ii iii tier carriers which are interested in effectively competing with the dominant carrier in their marketplace , 2 ) large multinational corporations which need to have us or european presence by having , ( for example ) , a united states number ringing in their offices in guatemala or london - - offering business partners a more economical way to communicate , and 3 ) immigrants in north america , a means of significantly lowering their communication expense with their relatives in their country of origin . conclusion : the examples above show the awesome , earning potential of little known companies that explode onto investor ' s radar screens ; many of you are already familiar with this . is ndin poised and positioned to do that for you ? then you may feel the time has come to act . . . and please watch this one trade monday ! go ndin . penny stocks are considered highly speculative and may be unsuitable for all but very aggressive investors . this profile is not in any way affiliated with the featured company . we were compensated 30 oo dollars to distribute this report . this report is for entertainment and advertising purposes only and should not be used as investment advice . if you wish to stop future mailings , or if you feel you have been wrongfully placed in our membership , send a blank e mail with no thanks in the sub ject to ournewsletter 24 @ yahoo . com)

[ strictly confidential ] i feel quite safe dealing with you in this important business having gone through your remarkable profile on the internet . though , this medium ( internet ) has been greatly abused , i choose to reach you through it because it still remains the fastest medium of communication . however , this correspondence is unofficial and private , and it should be treated as such . at first i will like to assure you that this transaction is 100 % risk and trouble free to both parties . my name is dr . collumbus walter from , i work as the operational manager in account management section in charge of credit and foreign bills of one of the prime banks here in south africa . on a routine inspection i discovered a dormant domiciliary account with a balance of us $ 48 , 223 , 000 . 00 ( forty eight million two hundred and twenty three thousand u . s dollar ) . on further discreet investigation , i also discovered that the account holder has died long ago with his family on a fatal auto - accident leaving no beneficiary to the account and no other person knows about this account . i am in close contact with the manager of the bank here who is my partner and he is willing to approve the transfer to any reliable and trustworthy foreigner with foreign bank account because the former operator of the a / c is a foreigner and from australia in particular . i am certainly sure that he has no writen or oral will attached to the account , no beneficiary and nobody will come again for the claim of this money . it is only a foreigner who can claim this money with legal claims to the account holder which i will provide to you if you are interested , therefore i need your cooperation in this transaction . the difference in country of origins is not a hindrance to the success of this transaction . this money will remain useless in this dormant account if i did not transfer the fund out to a foreign account . i will provide the necessary information and documents needed in order to claim this money . i only need your cooperation as a foreigner to provide your safe bank account information for the transfer . all arrangement that will ensure a smooth transfer of the fund to the account which you are to nominate is already in place . you should also provide me with your direct phone lines for easy communication . i wish for utmost confidentiality in handling this transaction . at the conclussion of this transaction , your share will be 25 % of the total transfer sum , 70 % for me and my partner while 5 % will be set aside for any expenses both parties might incure during the process of the transfer . the fund will be transferred to your account in two parts . i will first transfer usd 20 million to your account . i will fly over to meet you after the successful transfer for sharing according to the agreed percentages . i will have the remaining balance of usd 28 , 223 million transferred to your account only after the successful sharing of the first transfer without any disappointment from your side . have a nice day as i entrust this transfer into your hands . let me hear from you urgently . best regards , dr . walter . fax : 874 - 76 - 2533361 tel : 874 - 76 - 2533360)

( source : company website ) currently trading at . 012 p possibilty of an absolutely huge week as massive pr campaign has started and is expected to last all week . pp imagine how well your portfolio would have done the last month or so if you had the scoop on the following stock : p ( otcbb : mbah ) : this stock closed at . 01 on september lst . this little giant closed at . 06 on october 8 th , up 500 % in about 5 weeks . do you think ibm is going to move like that anytime soon ? p as many of you may agree , some , not all , of these stocks move in price because they are promoted , making a very large number of investors aware of the stock . the awareness is underway on dmxp ! pp let ' s look at the company , delta mining and exploration corp . otc : dmxpp about the company : p delta mining and exploration corp . otc : dmxp is a mineral exploration company that controls 6 properties totaling 7 , 554 acres ( approximately 11 sq . miles ) in montana . the properties are all located over what management considers to be some of the most prospective diamond exploration terrain in the united states . another 10 , 000 acres of prospective diamond and gold properties are controlled in bolivia , south america . initial work has revealed that the bolivian properties display similar potential to those found in north america . p the management team is led by chief executive officer , dr . barry rayment , who is experienced enough to take this junior exploration company to the next level . dr . rayment brings 32 years of experience in the field of geology , along with running some of the most successful mining companies in the industry . dr . rayment was the president of bema gold corp . , ( amex : bgo ) , a company with a market cap of close to a billion dollars . he was also affiliated with glamis gold , gold fields mining and amselco exploration ( bp minerals ) , among others . his vast experience in the mining sector along with his extensive knowledge of public companies will be an extraordinary asset to delta and its shareholders as the company moves forward . p among the support team is stephen kay , a geologist with more than 30 years experience in exploration throughout europe , south africa , south america and the united states . while with gold fields mining corp . , stephen kay was instrumental in the discovery and subsequent drilling of the 3 million ounce mesquite gold deposit in california . p delta has experienced significant technical success since its start - up in 1997 . for example , delta has discovered the first in - situ microdiamond ever found in montana on its homestead kimberlite , southeast of lewistown . the company also controls part of the three buttes kimberlite where initial exploration has shown the three buttes kimberlite to host typical diamond indicator minerals - a major step toward finding the presence of economic diamonds - including pyrope ( garnet ) , chromite and clinoprroxene . p an aggressive regional exploration program has the potential to discover additional kimberlite or lamproite pipes in this under - explored area to the south of known commercial diamond bearing kimberlites in saskatchewan and alberta , canada . p in bolivia , delta controls approximately two - thirds of a highly prospective diamondiferous terrain referred to as the independencia group of concessions covering 7 , 860 acres ( 12 sq miles ) . the other one - third is presently being explored by de beers . in addition to the independencia property delta controls more than 2 , 000 acres comprising the highly attractive precambrian property that displays all the diamond indicator minerals that would suggest further exploration is justified . p delta seeks to increase growth for its investors not only by testing its extensive portfolio of diamond exploration properties but also by acquiring additional diamond properties . delta will focus on identifying and developing strategic alliances with major mining companies as well as joint ventures to develop the properties and finance additional exploration . p in addition to the highly prospective diamond properties delta controls , they also control a gold property with great potential . the property is near la paz in bolivia , where initial analysis revealed high levels of gold per ton that would more than justify an extensive exploration program . pp ( source : company website ) p recent headlines : go online and read the full stories ! p delta mining and exploration corp . is invited to attend a conference with the bolivian chamber of commerce . p delta mining and exploration corp . visits homestead property in preparation of work program . p delta mining and exploration corp . discloses preliminary gold exploration findings in south america . p delta mining and exploration , corp . looks to continue diamond exploration in south america . pp will dmxp explode higher as more and more investors become aware of the stock this weekend and next week ?

( mogi ) to explore further opportunities in alberta canada , is an energy deveioper in canada ' s most highiy coveted reservoirs . aggressive investors and traders may want to watch montana oi | and gas again this morning ! montana oil and gas inc . ( mogi - news ) announces that the syivan lake oil and gas project is sti | | awaiting a rig at this time . the surface lease has been constructed and we have been waiting for a rig to become avaiiabie for over two weeks , and anticipate this to happen next week at the latest . the company has a 25 % working interest in the syivan lake project . symbo | - mogi current price - . 26 reasons to consider mogi : 1 . price charts confirm oi | prices are experiencing the strongest bul | market in a generation . 2 . natura | gas prices have tripled in the | ast two years . 3 . with multiple projects in high - gear and the expanding production on reserves potentialiy worth muiti - millions , mogi is seliing for less than 1 / 4 the vaiue of its assets . 4 . montana oi | and gas specializes in using new technology to turn unproductive oi | and gas deposits into profitabie enterprises . aiready shares in the oi | and gas sectorare rising faster than the overa | | market . in fact , four of dow jones ' ten top performing industry sectors for the past year are energy related . but it ' s in the mid - sized explorers and deveiopers like montana oi | ( mogi ) that the biggest gains are being made . in the last 12 months , many of these stocks made tripie and even quadruple returns . breaking news ! ! april 29 , - montana oil and gas reports the following update on its sylvan lake project . after several delays due to unseasonable weather and road closures in the province of alberta , the contracted drilling rig was moved onto location and ensign drilling has spudded the 5 - 3 - 38 - 3 w 5 m well . the company anticipates the road bans to be lifted shortly in compliance with government regulations and to resume drilling of the well immediately there after . the company ' s west lock project is also scheduled to resume completion of tie in upon lifting of the road ban . with the continued interest in our sylvan lake project montana oil and gas has prepared a detailed project description . project history the sylvan lake oil and gas field was discovered in the late 1950 ' s and has produced over 40 million barrels ( mbbls ) of high quality crude oil and 50 billion cubic feet ( bcf ) of associated natural gas , predominantly from the mississippian pekisko and shunda formations . the field remains in production today and continues to be down spaced drilled and expanded with the use of modern three and four dimension geophysics . the original freehold lease on section 3 - 38 - 3 w 5 m was leased to a major oil company , as was most of the sylvan lake field itself . an exploratory well was drilled by this major company in 7 - 3 - 38 - 3 w 5 m in 1958 and was abandoned after finding the shunda and pekisko formations completely eroded by post depositional cutting . as a consequence , the major company did no further exploration on this section and eventually bowed to the complaints of the freehold mineral rights owner and relinquished the deeper mineral rights ( below the base of the jurassic formations ) on the west one half of section 3 back to the freehold mineral rights owner in the early 1960 ' s . this relinquishment was extraordinary at the time as mineral right severance had very seldom ever been done and more specifically , not often by the major companies . accordingly , these mineral rights sat available and dormant until the early 2000 ' s as almost all oil and gas companies thought they were held by the original lessee . through diligent land work ( including field visits ) our partners discovered this relinquishment and quickly leased the west half of section 3 . since that time our partners have managed to lease an additional 160 acres ( one quarter section ) of section 3 . energy 51 has the right to earn 50 % of this prospect ( possibly 75 % ) with the drilling of a test well in 5 - 3 - 38 - 3 w 5 m . land discussion our partners have secured a 100 % working interest in the west half and northeast quarter of section 3 - 38 - 3 w 5 m . the land comprises some 480 acres ( one section or one square mile equals 640 acres ) . primary drilling spacing in alberta is as follows ; one quarter section spacing ( 160 acres ) for oil and one section spacing ( 640 acres ) for natural gas . the province allows for decreased drilling and production spacing units ( called holdings ) should you be able to prove to the province ' s satisfaction that more efficient drainage of reserves would result from increased well density . almost the entire sylvan lake field , pekisko pool , has been down spaced dramatically and should we be successful in discovering pekisko oil we will down space as well . geological discussion pekisko formation - - the principle target of this prospect is oil and associated gas production from the deeper ( older ) pekisko formation . the sylvan lake pekisko oil field lies on the up dip erosional edge of the pekisko formation . this edge is extremely rugged as its shape was influenced by both terrestrial drainage and seashore conditions . overlying this ancient shoreline are cap rocks ( impermeable layers ) of the mississippian lower shunda formation and cretaceous / jurassic impermeable shales . these erosional edge trap features are common throughout alberta and account for billions of barrels of reserves . production facilities discussion this immediate area has been developed for both oil and natural gas over the past forty - five years . accordingly a multitude of gas gathering and processing facilities and oil transportation facilities have been constructed . a major gas processing facility is located within two miles of our project with gathering system lines with one half a mile from our proposed drilling location . the capacity of the processing facility is approximately 70 mmcf / d with current throughput of only 46 mmcf / d . accordingly , excess capacity of 24 mmcf / d exists in the facility which would be in the best interest of the operator to fill as soon as possible . this gas processing facility also has oil pipeline access for the transportation of raw oil product to the main delivery terminals north of red deer , alberta . accordingly , trucking costs would be minimal to get oil product to the transportation system . for more detailed project description please see news release dated ( fri , apr 29 ) . good luck and successfu | trading . conclusion : the examples above show the awesome , earning potential of little known companies that explode onto investor ' s radar screens ; many of you are already familiar with this . is mogi poised and positioned to do that for you ? then you may feel the time has come to act . . . and please watch this one trade tuesday ! go mogi . penny stocks are considered highly speculative and may be unsuitable for all but very aggressive investors . this profile is not in any way affiliated with the featured company . we were compensated 3000 dollars to distribute this report . this report is for entertainment and advertising purposes only and should not be used as investment advice .)

( i simply add a piece of masking tape since it ' s easy to see . ) then when routing the gauge ( and later , the panel ) , always keep this mark against the straightedge . your dadoes should be right on . another email came in from mike , who suggested making two alignment gauges . then you can clamp one at each end of the workpiece before you clamp the straightedge fence down . this prevents the " wiggling " that often occurs when one end is clamped before the other . great tip ! a big thanks to all who have been sending in suggestions . it ' s great to hear that so many people are enjoying the tips . talk to you again in a few weeks . jon garbison on - line editor woodsmith visit our other woodworking and home improvement sites : 100 + woodworking plans : woodsmith magazine : shopnotes magazine : workbench magazine : kits , jigs , tools , project plans : back issues : woodworking forums : to change your email address or resubscribe , sign up again at to unsubscribe , send empty email message to : note : your subscribed email address is)

( and his bong ) 4 . gorons actually believe that mr . gore is justified in illegally raising political funds from the office of the vp , simply because the vanderbilt law educated vp claims he was ignorant of the illegality . 5 . gorons further believe that it was ok for al to accept large sums of political money from china through buddhist monks who had taken vows of poverty , since he again claimed ignorance . 6 . gorons also believe that the man who claimed to " invent the internet " would be so computationally ignorant that he could lose weeks of potentially incriminating e - mail ! 7 . gorons , incredibly , believe gore ' s claim that he and tipper were the models for the book and movie , " love story " even though the book ' s author , erich segal , says not . 8 . gorons , amazingly , believe that gore will be the consumer ' s champion against high gasoline prices although gore holds a million dollars in occidental petroleum stock . 9 . gorons applaud mr . lieberman ' s open rejection of president clinton ' s immorality , but believe it was fine for mr . gore to remain silent on the subject , while simultaneously declaring mr . clinton " one of the greatest presidents of our history . " 10 . gorons believe that al gore is an effective leader , when they won ' t bother to look at his record as a tennessee senator , a record so ineffective that it has led to the election of republicans as both of tennessee ' s senators ! 11 . gorons hold the belief that gore is a compassionate man who will be the working man ' s friend , in spite of the eviction notice he served to the poor family who complained about the conditions of the run down slum house that he was renting to them . cautionary note : medical researchers acknowledge that gorons are generally harmless , except when allowed into a voting booth . there , unfortunately , overcome by their gullibility syndrome , they are apt to actually vote for gore ! they should be carefully protected from their ailment , since it may be harmful to their well - being , yours , mine and that of the usa . therefore , please , heed the surgeon general ' s warning , reach out to aid the gorons in overcoming the syndrome , and , please , pass this on to your normal friends , who might also know gorons who need immediate treatment .)

(3008.2000-12-05.farmer.ham.txt,Subject: texas general land office it transport gerald / eric - i have a couple of questions regarding tglo transport contract 012 - 88494 - 202 . we are currently delivering a volume of 28 . 000 mm into various midcon interconnects on this contract that are designated to go to reliant / entex for the purpose of heating hisd schools . the transport contract stipulates different rates for this delivery depending on whether the gas is intended for state facilities or not . my first question , then , is : are hisd schools considered state facilities ? and , if hisd schools are considered state facilities , does the fact that this gas is being delivered to them via reliant / entex utilizing midcon ' s pipe make any difference ? i am asking these questions not only to assure that we are recouping the correct transport rate , but also to determine what the consequences might be if i interrupt this delivery . we are having difficulty getting enough gas into midcon to cover our entex noms and i am just exploring my options . i would also expect that this volume should decrease when hisd closes for the christmas holidays - does the fact that this is an it agreement give me enough leverage to cut this nom if tglo does not do so voluntarily ? thanks for your help .)

[ pinion , richard ] to restate the question for clarity , in path manager a scheduler pulls down a supply , market and a service , adds any up / downstream contract information and / or duns or drn override and then saves it . unify looks for an old path with those exact variables and if it finds it re - uses it and if it does not find an exact match creates a new path and path id . i had been told that to do away with this function would create an unacceptably high amount of paths since any path once nominated on could not be deleted . has this changed ? ? ? at one time there were some schedulers that looked for the same path / activity number match for nominations . texas eastern was the only pipeline that needed the old activity numbers no matter how long it had been since they were used . i spoke with chris ordway and the new link system no longer needs this to occur . transco uses activity numbers but uses the activity number cross reference table to that function and therefore should not be affected . therefore , if it does not create a space or memory problem for unify , i don ' t think that this constant old path look up is needed . [ kinsey , lisa ] get rid of this . 2 ) the scheduling position window : does anyone use this ? if not , we ' ll remove the code logic that populates this window . i have never seen a scheduler use this . please verify . [ pinion , richard ] originally such a window was in use by everyone in the legacy system " autonoms " so it was duplicated in unify by request . it is not used in unify now because of the other sophisticated tools unify provides which obviate it ' s use . the only value would be notification of bridge errors or contract imbalances but there are other ways to determine those problems . as voted on in a previous meeting of the managers - lose it ! [ kinsey , lisa ] why is this still here ? 3 ) on the inventory pool list , does anyone need to see the contarct references list ? again , this code is called every retrieval time and doesn ' t appear to be used from my observations . if they do need this information , we could provide it , but if not , i ' d prefer to remove the functionality . [ pinion , richard ] this function is still very much in use by those with point based pipelines that must use the imbalance pool to facilitate balancing nomination volumes where multiple pipeline external pools exist and are pathed through the same contract imbalance pool . keep it ! [ kinsey , lisa ] yes . we use this functionality a lot when pathing pools . 4 ) when pathing a one to many or many to one set of paths , what ' s the average number of paths they create at one time ? what about updates ? i know that anr and nigas are big users of this feature since they have small packages of gas that they are limited in size to . does the system seem faster when you update one record at a time or chunks of records ? my real question is how often they do this and for what number of paths on both updates and inserts . by update , i mean , going to the path list and changing an upstream / downstream contract or a psna which in turn forces a new path to be created . [ pinion , richard ] this one to many or many to one pathing goes on every day on every pipeline . there is no ' average ' . they typically update a path with up / downstream meters or duns or dnb numbers one at a time however . i hope this answers your question . i see no change to this process at this time [ kinsey , lisa ] on some pipes this function is used more than others . when it is used we try and do as many paths as possible . at this time i do not see a need to change this process . 5 ) on brokered paths , do you want to utilize the same logic we have for service ? in other words , when updating brokered arrangements , we don ' t incorporate the same logic for zeroing out the path and recreating a new arrangment link and hence sending it to be renominated ? why do we do this for service ? is it because we have to renominate it ? i assume that ' s what it ' s for since we don ' t send brokered paths to the pipe . anyway , with the nomlogic implmentation ( two way interface ) , we were planning on having it behave the same way as service . we need this verified . [ pinion , richard ] we don ' t perform the same logic for brokered paths because these are not nominated to the pipeline and hence do not need a zero path to be resent to the pipeline when a significant change is made to the already nominated path . i don ' t see a need to change the way brokered paths are behaving at this time . [ kinsey , lisa ] agree with richard .)

if so , why don ' t they fly them ? why do all the international lines except russia fly american planes ? why does no other land on earth even consider putting a man or woman on the moon ? you talk about japanese technocracy , and you get radios . you talk about german technocracy , and you get automobiles . you talk about american technocracy , and you find men on the moon - not once , but several times - and safely home again . you talk about scandals , and the americans put theirs right in the store window for everybody to look at . even their draft - dodgers are not pursued and hounded . they are here on our streets , and most of them , unless they are breaking canadian laws , are getting american dollars from ma and pa at home to spend here . when the railways of france , germany and india were breaking down through age , it was the americans who rebuilt them . when the pennsylvania railroad and the new york central went broke , nobody loaned them an old caboose . both are still broke . i can name you 5000 times when the americans raced to the help of other people in trouble . can you name me even one time when someone else raced to the americans in trouble ? i don ' t think there was outside help even during the san francisco earthquake . our neighbors have faced it alone , and i ' m one canadian who is damned tired of hearing them get kicked around . they will come out of this thing with their flag high . and when they do , they are entitled to thumb their nose at the lands that are gloating over their present troubles . i hope canada is not one of those . " stand proud , america ! wear it proudly ! ! this is one of the best editorials that i have ever read regarding the united states . it is nice that one man realizes it . i only wish that the rest of the world would realize it . we are always blamed for everything , and never even get a thank you for the things we do . i would hope that each of you would send this to as many people as you can and emphasize that they should send it to as many of their friends until this letter is sent to every person on the web . i am just a single american that has read this , tribute to the united states = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = ? easy unsubscribe click here : http : / / topica . com / u / ? a 84 vnf . a 9 ivhm ? or send an email to : brcc . yf - unsubscribe @ topica . com ? this email was sent to : dfarmer @ enron . com ? ? t o p i c a - - register now to manage your mail ! ? http : / / www . topica . com / partner / tago 2 / register ? = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = =)

(1691.2000-07-20.farmer.ham.txt,Subject: new version of stack manager introduction in response to feedback received from enron traders worldwide , we have upgraded and improved the stack manager to include new functionality which we hope will improve its effectiveness and usefulness in the management of your products . this new release will be automatically installed within the next few days . please ensure you log out at night in order to receive the upgrade . summary of new features multiple children - a " child " product can be the " parent " of another child ( multiple links in a chain ) and different types of links can be placed against a single parent . static product bar prices - when you change a price in the product bar and hit the " + " or " - " button , the price stays - it does not reset to the amount in product properties until you logout . sorting - you can sort by any field on the products tab simply by clicking on the title of the field . for multiple sorts , hold down your " shift " key . parent products which are at the top of a stack do not have their basis relationship identified . ( e . g . the product bar might before have said : " basis link - parent " and now would say " stand alone , parent " ) . detailed feature descriptions multiple children the new version of enrononline allows you to link several products together in a long chain . for example , child product a can be linked to parent product b , which is in turn linked to parent product c . warning : although there is no absolute limit to the number of links in a chain , system performance is degraded by large chains . this is because when a customer attempts a transaction , the database must " lock " each and every product in the chain before it can process the transaction request . the database must then update the stack for each product before releasing the locks . " vertical " chains ( multiple parents and children in one long link ) are much slower to process than " flat " chains ( one parent with many children ) . large vertical chains should be avoided . related to this feature is the ability to have several types of links on the same parent . for example , child product a can have a basis link to parent product b . at the same time , child product c can have a syncopated basis link to the same parent product b . parent b is the parent for both a syncopated basis link and a regular basis link . static product bar prices the new version of enrononline provides for " sticky " product bar price and volume changes . when you change a number on the product bar , it does not reset to the number contained in the product properties menu until after you have logged out . this makes it easier to update prices , volumes , spreads or offsets in a changing market without repeated hits to the " + " or " - " buttons . one of the benefits of setting these numbers to appropriate levels is that it reduces repeated price movements . with the old version of stack manager , if the price delta was too small , traders would often repeatedly hit the price movement buttons . each of these price changes must be communicated across the website to customers and consumes valuable bandwidth . this makes it harder for customers to transact with us - each time they try , a new price update moves the price , resulting in an increased transaction failure rate . entering an appropriate price into the price delta field and then pressing the price movement button means that fewer ( but larger ) price movements are necessary , improving overall system response and reducing customer transaction failure rate . you may also notice a new addition to the product bar prices - a new field for offset to last trade . this allows you to update the offset for products which have offset to last trade selected from the product properties menu . sorting / selecting the new version of enrononline provide significant additional sorting functionality over the old . you can now choose any field heading ( type , location , reference period , etc . ) and sort by that item . you can do multiple sorts by holding down the shift key . example : if you select type and then location while holding the shift key , you will see your products sorted first by product type and then within each product type , by location ( in alphabetical order ) . if you right click on the product menu , you can choose from the same sort criteria , plus you can select " sort by web order " , which allows you to see your products in the same order as they would appear to a customer on the website ( note however , that a customer on the website might be also seeing a number of products in addition to the ones you are managing ) . when you select products , you can drag your mouse while holding down the left mouse button as always , but now you can also hold down the key while making your selections . this allows you to highlight products which are not necessarily adjacent to one another . parent products and f / x products one of the differences in the way that the new version works is in its treatment of how parent products are displayed . the old version showed the type of link associated with the parent in the product bar ( to the left of the main product bar update buttons above the products tabs ) . the new version does not show the type of link . this is because the new version allows for more than one type of link on each parent product . some traders may notice that their products which have f / x links are now identified with a stylised " fx " in the product list . this is to enable easy identification of products which are run as a foreign exchange link to the parent , rather than managed individually . assistance as always , if you have any problems with any enrononline functionality , please contact the 24 hour help desk ( houston : 713 853 4357 , london : + 44 ( 0 ) 20 7783 7783 , australia : + 61 2 9229 2300 ) . general feedback if you have any comments on the new functionality , or suggestions for further functionality , please call david forster on 713 853 1861 . if you had previously suggested new functionality which didn ' t make it into this release , rest assured that you have not been forgotten - we are working hard to improve all elements of enrononline and will try to incorporate your requests into the next release of the enrononline stack manager .)

(0572.2000-03-07.farmer.ham.txt,Subject: p & l tom , we attached both a consolidated p & l and an updated prudency schedule . the weater hedge made $ 165 , 000 today . the only odd thing that we saw was the physical change due to deal changes with the hplc operational desk . this desk is a desk that is set up to account for fuel , gas loss , and physical ua 4 , we have tickets out there with zero volumes on them that get updated after the month is over once volume management knows where the gas needs to be allocated . what we found out that happened was that in the last week of february and in the first week of march sitara added volumes to these tickets before were were running comparison reports to see the changes . darren noticed the incorrect volumes on these tickets and had logistics zero them out . darren thought that the changes would have no position effect as if it were a deal between hplc and texas , but it is actuall as if we changed a deal that we did with another region . the value was offset by changes in tufco and storage . we released $ 270 , 000 out of march prudency to keep you flat for the day . hope you had fun at the school function . i ' ll be here until about 8 : 30 , so feel free to call if you get this . bryan)

( this has been the stated process for the bottom two categories , and we are adding satisfactory to this process as well . ) please remember to include a more experienced member of your management team , yourself , or an hr professional in reviews being conducted by inexperienced members of your management team , or those management team members where you have a concern over their ability or willingness to deliver candid and perhaps tough performance feedback . i believe that we have spent some time in identifying these situations . i ask your help to ensure that we follow through on this commitment . thanks for all of your efforts in making this mid - year prc process a meaningful one . it is dave delainey ' s intent to announce it if 0)

' ' enbridge partners will acquire 1 , 880 miles of various diameter gathering lines , 37 compressor stations , four gas treating plants with a capacity of 595 mmcf / d and three gas processing plants with a combined capacity of 375 mmcf / d . the transaction is anticipated to close in december . the intrastate system derives revenues from the purchase , transportation and resale of natural gas . additionally , when natural gas liquids fractionation spreads are positive , the option exists to extract ngls from purchased gas , thus leveraging income with incremental processing revenue , the company noted . the partnership expects that the direct commodity price exposures inherent in gas purchase and resale activities and in gas processing will be suitably mitigated through a hedging strategy . it forecasts gas supply available to the system will be 400 - 420 mmcf / d in 2002 . based on this estimate , the acquisition would contribute incremental ebitda of between $ 26 million and $ 32 million for the year , while distributable cash flow would increase by between $ 0 . 10 and $ 0 . 15 per unit , with further improvements anticipated in 2003 . the forecasts assume that acquisition financing will consist of 50 % debt and 50 % equity , in line with enbridge partners target long - term capital structure . enbridge partners also reported third quarter net income of $ 6 . 6 million , or $ 0 . 13 per common unit , compared with net income of $ 14 . 2 million , or $ 0 . 42 per unit , for the third quarter in 2000 . the decline was attributed mainly to an adjustment to oil inventory due to shippers of $ 5 . 4 million . the adjustment was the result of what enbridge said were refinements in the oil loss estimation process , as well as improvements in the accuracy of measuring oil losses while developing new software applications . third quarter deliveries were 1 , 208 million b / d compared to 1 , 272 mmb / d for the same period in the prior year . the partnership expects that deliveries will increase over the remainder of the year , to average between 1 . 30 and 1 . 33 mmb / d . however , its delivery estimates for 2001 and 2002 are down from prior expectations because of lower production forecasts for conventional heavy crude oil , which stem from the current wide price differential between heavy and light crude . for 2002 , growing oil sands production is anticipated to boost full - year average deliveries to between 1 . 35 and 1 . 43 mmb / d . " the partnership ' s forecast indicates that crude oil delivery volumes , which have languished for the past several quarters , will start to improve modestly in the near term with more significant increases occurring in the latter half of 2002 , " said tutcher . " the major contributing factor will be increased production from the immense oil sands reserves in western canada . we also anticipate further successes from our acquisition strategy , which will increase earnings and diversify our sources of income . the partnership ' s primary objective over the next two to three years is to accelerate the growth of cash distributions to unitholders . to that end , we are confident that the acquisition of the east texas facilities combined with some improvement in liquid hydrocarbon deliveries will position the partnership to consider a distribution increase in 2002 .
