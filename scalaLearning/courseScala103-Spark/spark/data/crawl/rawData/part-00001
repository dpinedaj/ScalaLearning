" some pipelines do not allow us to change counterparties after there is feedback - i assume for the same reasons we had this rule - it used to blow up our old scheduling systems ( pre - unify ) . some pipelines will require a new deal and we will have to zero out the old deal . before you make the change - make sure the logistics person is aware - just in case it causes problems with their pipeline . sorry - i don ' t know which pipes these are - you will have to ask the unify team . there is one rule still in place - you can change from ena - im east to ena - im market east - but not from ena - im texas to hplc - im hplc - when changing business units - they must be the same legal entity . " warning - not the same legal entity " also - beware of making contract and counterparty changes to service deals ( transport capacity , storage , cash out ) . once the deal is invalidated - there are no rules . don ' t forget - the items were locked down for a reason . if you invalidate a service deal - and change the previously locked down data that was validated - and someone used these deals in unify - it is highly likely that the unify deals and paths created using these deals will get corrupted . always check with someone from unify to make sure no one used these deals for anything in unify . - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - forwarded by thomas engel / hou / ect on 04 / 05 / 2000 09 : 47 am - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - from : scott mills on 04 / 04 / 2000 07 : 38 pm to : kathryn cordes / hou / ect @ ect , dana daigle / corp / enron @ enron , elizabeth l hernandez / hou / ect @ ect , julie meyers / hou / ect @ ect , b scott palmer / hou / ect @ ect , stephanie sever / hou / ect @ ect , dianne j swiber / hou / ect @ ect cc : steve jackson / hou / ect @ ect , thomas engel / hou / ect @ ect , sylvia a campos / hou / ect @ ect , linda s bryan / hou / ect @ ect , faye ellis / hou / ect @ ect , donna consemiu / hou / ect @ ect subject : sitara release ( re : changes in global due to consent to assignment ) with the release that was put out tuesday evening , deal validation should be able to change the counterparty on deals where the volume is something other than expected ( e . g . confirmed , nominated , scheduled , etc . ) . in addition , this release will also capture " near - time " the contract changes that are made in global . this means that need for server bounces will not be necessary . new / changes to contracts will show up without having to get out of deal manager . new counterparties , and new / changes to facilities will require getting out of all active sitara apps ( except for launch pad ) . once out of all apps , start a new app - the respective information that you are looking for will appear . i mention " near - time " because we are constrained by the amount of time it takes for the change in global data to trigger an alert for sitara who then updates its information srm ( x 33548 ) cyndie balfour - flanagan @ enron 04 / 04 / 2000 03 : 41 pm to : connie sutton / hou / ect @ ect , linda s bryan / hou / ect @ ect , kathryn cordes / hou / ect @ ect , scott mills / hou / ect @ ect , richard elwood / hou / ect @ ect , dave nommensen / hou / ect @ ect , kenneth m harmon / hou / ect @ ect , dana daigle / corp / enron @ enron , kathryn cordes / hou / ect @ ect , elizabeth l hernandez / hou / ect @ ect , julie meyers / hou / ect @ ect , b scott palmer / hou / ect @ ect , stephanie sever / hou / ect @ ect , dianne j swiber / hou / ect @ ect , gayle horn / corp / enron @ enron , brant reves / hou / ect @ ect , russell diamond / hou / ect @ ect , debbie r brackett / hou / ect @ ect , steve jackson / hou / ect @ ect cc : subject : changes in global due to consent to assignment the following changes will be made in the global contracts database due to receipt of executed consent to assignment for the following contracts : current counterparty name contract type contract # ' new ' counterparty name ces - commonwealth energy services gisb 96029892 commonwealth energy services ces - samuel gary jr . & associates , inc gisb 96029302 samuel gary jr . & associates ces - south jersey gas company gisb 96029143 south jersey gas company cp name change and contract type correction ( contract type different than that provided by ces ) per ces ces - southwest gas corporation 1 / 1 / 98 gisb 96029146 per contract file ces - southwest gas corporation 04 / 14 / 93 master purchase / sale interruptible ( will edit global # 96029146 ) & ces - southwest gas corporation 12 / 01 / 94 master sale firm ( created new global record to accommodate this k , # 96037402 ) please note that southwest gas corporation has consented to the assignment of both of these contracts .)

( all intrastate pipelines that perform section 311 service must either have their rates approved by ferc or they must charge rates that are approved by a state regulatory body for a similar service . ) pg & e ' s filing proposed , in addition to the usual interruptible service , a firm section 311 service as well as an interruptible parking and lending service . pg & e also filed a revised statement of operating conditions to reflect the new services . 2 ) on february 25 , 2000 , southern union gas company , an intrastate transportation customer of pg & e , filed a late motion to intervene and raised issues which it stated should be addressed in a hearing . pg & e opposed the late intervention , but ferc granted it on april 14 , 2000 . ( pg & e stated that southern union was intervening in order to gain leverage in renegotiating its contract for intrastate service . ) 3 ) southern union submitted data requests to pg & e on april 13 and april 17 . pg & e attempted to get a protective order issued , but ferc rejected their request . 4 ) a settlement conference was held on september 7 , 2000 . 5 ) a staff panel was convened on october 2 , 2000 , in order to conduct an advisory , non - evidentiary proceeding for oral arguments on the issues , with instructions to make recommendations to the commission within 90 days . 6 ) on november 1 , 2000 , ferc requested 5 pages of additional information from pg & e in order to complete the application in the proceeding , which pg & e provided on november 8 th . on december 8 th , pg & e provided additional information in response to a ferc data request . 7 ) on january 10 , 2001 , southern union submitted a proposed alternative to the cost of service and rate design that was filed by pg & e . 8 ) on january 17 , el paso field services informed ferc that pg & e texas pipeline , lp had been acquired by el paso on december 22 , 2000 , and that the name was changed to epgt texas pipeline , lp . 9 ) on january 24 , 2001 , epgt texas and southern union filed initial briefs . 10 ) on july 17 , 2001 , epgt filed supplemental comments in response to the discussion at ferc summarized below , where commissioner wood inquired about the extension of some order no . 636 and 637 provisions to section 311 service providers . epgt stated that , if ferc proceeds with this policy , it should do so in a generic rulemaking and not in an individual pipeline proceeding . on july 30 , 2001 , southern union filed reply comments opposing epgt ' s supplemental comments . 11 ) on august 3 , epgt filed an amended statement of operating conditions , which provides for electronic nominations , two additional nomination cycles , bumping , clarified and updated credit provisions , modified quality provisions to protect system integrity , and more clearly defined authorized overrun service . the ngpa gives ferc authority over intrastate pipeline rates for section 311 service and requires that such service be provided on a non - discriminatory basis , but there is some question as to whether it gives ferc authority to require , for example , compliance with order nos . 636 and 637 . please let me know if this is enough detail ( or maybe it ' s more than you wanted ! ! ) .)

(4986.2001-10-17.farmer.ham.txt,Subject: ferc issues nopr on intra - day recalls of released capacity ngi ' s daily gas price index published : october 17 , 2001 ferc issues nopr on intra - day recalls of released capacity given the inability of the natural gas standards - setting organization to resolve the issue of intra - day recalls of released transportation capacity , ferc has issued a notice of proposed rulemaking ( nopr ) that would give releasing shippers the flexibility to re - nominate their recalled capacity at the next scheduling opportunity provided by an interstate pipeline . existing gas industry standards board ( gisb ) standards require a shipper that wants to re - nominate recalled capacity to notify its transportation provider by no later than 8 a . m . central clock time ( cct ) on a nomination day at the latest , and bars partial - day recalls of capacity . ferc proposes to allow shippers to recall capacity and re - nominate the recalled capacity at each of the three intra - day nomination opportunities . " by enabling releasing shippers to recall and renominate capacity quickly , they will have greater incentive to release capacity , providing capacity purchasers with an alternative to purchasing pipeline interruptible service . at the same time , this proposal will provide replacement shippers whose capacity is recalled with the same advance notice and protection from bumping as is provided to interruptible shippers under the commission ' s regulations , " the nopr said [ rm 96 - 1 - 019 ] . existing gisb standards applying to capacity - release recalls were adopted in 1996 , when there was only one nomination per day at 11 : 30 a . m cct and a single non - standardized intra - day nomination , it noted . " but the circumstances under which the recall standards were developed have markedly changed as the number of nomination opportunities have now expanded to four nomination opportunities . " given the lack of " consensus supporting " gisb ' s existing recall standards and the standards - setting group ' s failure to settle the issue , the commission is forced to " resolve the policy question regarding partial - day recalls , " the nopr said . permitting partial - day recalls of released capacity , the commission concluded , was in keeping with the overall regulatory changes that it enacted in order 637 . the natural gas supply association ( ngsa ) , which represents major producers , and houston - based dynegy let ferc know that they weren ' t big fans of partial - day recalls . these could undermine system reliability , they contend , by shutting in production and increasing scheduling problems , overruns , penalties or operational flow orders . but the commission discounted these arguments . " . . . [ t ] he use of partial - day recalls should create no additional scheduling problems since recalls will be scheduled according to the existing scheduling requirements . in effect , releasing shippers using partial - day recalls are creating another form of interruptible transportation to compete with pipeline interruptible capacity , and shippers purchasing recallable capacity should be subject to the same scheduling rules that apply to interruptible transportation . partial - day recalls will be no more likely to result in shut - in production than interruptible transactions that are subject to being bumped under the current standards , " the nopr noted .)

it runs through this processing on the application and generally doesn ' t find a match . i know patti has mentioned this several times and i can ' t think of a valid reason for performing this work . i talked with dave nommensen , and according to him , what used to happen is that sometimes schedulers would get duplicate paths out there which is why they put this code in place ? ? ? from a scheduling perspective , my understanding of what your main concern is to just maintain your position and be able to change it . if you were overpathed , you ' d see it in the path manager either way . [ pinion , richard ] to restate the question for clarity , in path manager a scheduler pulls down a supply , market and a service , adds any up / downstream contract information and / or duns or drn override and then saves it . unify looks for an old path with those exact variables and if it finds it re - uses it and if it does not find an exact match creates a new path and path id . i had been told that to do away with this function would create an unacceptably high amount of paths since any path once nominated on could not be deleted . has this changed ? ? ? at one time there were some schedulers that looked for the same path / activity number match for nominations . texas eastern was the only pipeline that needed the old activity numbers no matter how long it had been since they were used . i spoke with chris ordway and the new link system no longer needs this to occur . transco uses activity numbers but uses the activity number cross reference table to that function and therefore should not be affected . therefore , if it does not create a space or memory problem for unify , i don ' t think that this constant old path look up is needed . [ kinsey , lisa ] get rid of this . 2 ) the scheduling position window : does anyone use this ? if not , we ' ll remove the code logic that populates this window . i have never seen a scheduler use this . please verify . [ pinion , richard ] originally such a window was in use by everyone in the legacy system " autonoms " so it was duplicated in unify by request . it is not used in unify now because of the other sophisticated tools unify provides which obviate it ' s use . the only value would be notification of bridge errors or contract imbalances but there are other ways to determine those problems . as voted on in a previous meeting of the managers - lose it ! [ kinsey , lisa ] why is this still here ? 3 ) on the inventory pool list , does anyone need to see the contarct references list ? again , this code is called every retrieval time and doesn ' t appear to be used from my observations . if they do need this information , we could provide it , but if not , i ' d prefer to remove the functionality . [ pinion , richard ] this function is still very much in use by those with point based pipelines that must use the imbalance pool to facilitate balancing nomination volumes where multiple pipeline external pools exist and are pathed through the same contract imbalance pool . keep it ! [ kinsey , lisa ] yes . we use this functionality a lot when pathing pools . 4 ) when pathing a one to many or many to one set of paths , what ' s the average number of paths they create at one time ? what about updates ? i know that anr and nigas are big users of this feature since they have small packages of gas that they are limited in size to . does the system seem faster when you update one record at a time or chunks of records ? my real question is how often they do this and for what number of paths on both updates and inserts . by update , i mean , going to the path list and changing an upstream / downstream contract or a psna which in turn forces a new path to be created . [ pinion , richard ] this one to many or many to one pathing goes on every day on every pipeline . there is no ' average ' . they typically update a path with up / downstream meters or duns or dnb numbers one at a time however . i hope this answers your question . i see no change to this process at this time [ kinsey , lisa ] on some pipes this function is used more than others . when it is used we try and do as many paths as possible . at this time i do not see a need to change this process . 5 ) on brokered paths , do you want to utilize the same logic we have for service ? in other words , when updating brokered arrangements , we don ' t incorporate the same logic for zeroing out the path and recreating a new arrangment link and hence sending it to be renominated ? why do we do this for service ? is it because we have to renominate it ? i assume that ' s what it ' s for since we don ' t send brokered paths to the pipe . anyway , with the nomlogic implmentation ( two way interface ) , we were planning on having it behave the same way as service . we need this verified . [ pinion , richard ] we don ' t perform the same logic for brokered paths because these are not nominated to the pipeline and hence do not need a zero path to be resent to the pipeline when a significant change is made to the already nominated path . i don ' t see a need to change the way brokered paths are behaving at this time . [ kinsey , lisa ] agree with richard .)

(2800.2000-11-08.farmer.ham.txt,Subject: organizational changes we are making a number of significant organizational changes . these changes are intended to accomplish four key objectives : first , we need to realign all our wholesale businesses around the successful business model developed over the last decade in north america and europe . this model relies on extensive physical and transactional networks built around a relatively small strategic asset position . second , we need to significantly streamline corporate reporting relationships . particularly with joe sutton  , s departure , the ability to directly manage the day - to - day activities of 15 independent business units has become increasingly difficult . third , we need to accomplish these changes without , in any way , compromising the ongoing profitability of all our businesses and without delaying or hindering our effort to monetize a significant portion of our lower - yielding asset positions . and fourth , as always , we need to take advantage of the reorganization to redeploy our talent into our highest value opportunities . enron wholesale services today , we are forming enron wholesale services ( ews ) which will consolidate our global wholesale businesses . the closer alignment of our wholesale businesses will accomplish the following : ( 1 ) enhanced communication and coordination across business units , ( 2 ) more rapid deployment of people to higher valued opportunities , ( 3 ) more effective prioritization of opportunities across the wholesale business , and ( 4 ) more rapid extension of enron  , s wholesale business model and capabilities into new industries and markets . enron wholesale services will include our current north american , european ( including japan and australia ) , global markets , and industrial markets operations , and will be expanded to include enron  , s net works business unit as well as a new unit  ) enron global assets . in addition , enron  , s merchant businesses outside of north america and europe will be integrated into this new structure as described below . mark frevert , currently chairman of each of our wholesale units , will assume the role of chairman and ceo of enron wholesale services . greg whalley , currently chairman and ceo of enron net works , will join mark in the office of the chairman as president and chief operating officer . providing further impetus for these organizational changes , several of our international business unit leaders have elected to move into new leadership positions : rebecca mcdonald , currently ceo of enron apachi , will join ews as president and ceo of enron global assets . enron global assets will have responsibility for managing all of enron  , s existing energy asset portfolio outside of north america and europe . joining rebecca in the office of the chairman as coo will be jim hughes , currently coo of enron apachi . rebecca and jim will report to the ews office of the chairman . sanjay bhatnagar , currently ceo of enron india , has joined ebs as ceo for the middle east and asia region . sanjay will be responsible for building our broadband business in this region and the current ebs team in this region will report to sanjay . in this role , sanjay will report to the ebs office of the chairman . in addition , sanjay will continue to remain responsible for enron  , s wholesale energy business in india and will transition this business into enron global assets in the near future . diomedes christodoulou , currently co - ceo of enron south america , has joined ebs as chief commercial officer . diomedes will be located in london and will focus his origination activities on global opportunities , with near term attention to the wholesale and enterprise sectors . diomedes will report to the ebs office of the chairman . jim bannantine , currently co - ceo of enron south america , will be joining ees to lead ees  , commercial efforts outside north america and europe . in order to ensure a smooth transition for our south american businesses and to facilitate our asset sales activities , jim will remain in south america for at least the next several months and continue to serve as ceo of enron south america . throughout the transition , jim will report to cliff baxter and to the office of the chairman of enron wholesale services . following the transition , jim will join ees . in addition to these changes in our international asset operations activities , we are making the following changes in our merchant wholesale businesses and the commercial support functions : enron net works louise kitchen will assume greg  , s previous responsibilities as president and ceo of enron net works , reporting into mark and greg . enron americas concurrent with the transfer to enron global assets of responsibility for operating enron  , s south and central america asset base , all trading , marketing , and new asset development activities in these regions will report into a new entity , enron americas . enron americas will have responsibility for all wholesale merchant businesses across north , central and south america . dave delainey , president and ceo , and john lavorato , chief operating officer will comprise the office of the chairman for enron americas . enron europe the enron europe organization , which includes enron  , s businesses in australia and japan , and enron metals , remains unchanged under the leadership of john sherriff , president and ceo , and michael brown , chief operating officer . enron global markets enron global markets , under the leadership of mike mcconnell , president and ceo , and jeff shankman , chief operating officer , will continue to have responsibility for enron  , s middle east and lng operations . with the exception of ecoelectrica in puerto rico , all operating power plants and associated personnel in the caribbean and central america will transfer to enron global assets . enron global markets will also continue to manage the commodity businesses in crude and products , coal , weather , insurance , equities , interest rates , foreign exchange , and agricultural products . enron industrial markets enron industrial markets  , organization , under the leadership of jeff mcmahon , president & ceo , and ray bowen , chief operating officer , remains unchanged . commercial support for ews the commercial support functions for ews will remain with , and be managed by , the individual business units . we are creating no incremental overhead in the creation of ews , and in fact hope to reduce our operating costs by more efficient utilization and sharing of resources across ews . to this end we have asked several people to take on an expanded role across ews in addition to their ongoing roles within their business units . these newly defined roles are as follows : mid and back office operations  ) sally beck will lead mid and back office operations across ews . these services will become part of enron net works , with sally reporting to louise kitchen and rick causey , executive vice president and chief accounting officer . this alignment creates a coordinated services organization with it and e - commerce platforms to support the wholesale businesses and to maximize opportunities to commercialize these services . mid and back office services for all commercial activities will continue to be organized with dedicated operations controllers responsible for specific commodities and / or geographic locations . legal  ) mark haedicke will serve in the role of general counsel for ews . regulatory and government affairs  ) this function will remain organized on a regional basis . rick shapiro will support all ews businesses operating in the americas , and mark schroeder , who is based in london , will support all european and eastern hemisphere operations . rick and mark will also continue to support all other enron businesses operating in their respective regions and will continue to report to steve kean , executive vice president and chief of staff . public relations  ) this function is also organized primarily on a regional basis . eric thode will have responsibility for north american activity , enron net works , and enron industrial markets . jackie gentle will continue in her role for enron europe ( including japan and australia ) and john ambler will have responsibility for activity outside north america and europe as well as providing support for enron global markets and enron global assets . these individuals will also continue to have a split reporting relationship to mark palmer , vice president of communications . business analysis and reporting  ) wes colwell will expand his role to cover ews reporting in addition to his current role in north america . attached for your review is an organization chart for enron wholesale services which summarizes the changes described here . as this organization continues to evolve we will keep you informed of any additional changes . enron global exploration and production and enron wind as part of our company -

on your rc report i wanted to let all of you know how you will be charged for analysts if you currently have or will have one in your rc for the year 2000 . the analyst program is being handled differently than it was in 1999 . in addition to the normal salary , benefits and payroll taxes , you will also be charged an overhead administration fee for the program . you will be charged the following monthly amounts for each analyst in the detail class code that i have indicated below : detail class description amount 1 salaries and wages $ 4 , 000 552 benefits 774 557 payroll taxes 360 820 corporate services 1 , 266 total monthly cost $ 6 , 400 the $ 4000 amount represents an average of all analyst salaries and does not indicate what the analyst in your rc is paid . this amount will not change in february as the $ 4000 already includes merit raise information for 2000 . the $ 1266 represents the overhead costs of administering the program , including campus recruiting and office visits . when you look at your rc report , you will see a line item labeled " a and a reclass " in each of the detail classes identified above . enron north america is invoiced by corp . for the costs of all analysts . financial operations makes a manual journal entry each month to charge the appropriate rc . please check your january 2000 rc report and make sure you were properly charged for the correct number of analysts you have currently . if there are any errors , please let me know as soon as possible so that i can work with brian heinrich to have it corrected in february . please continue to check your rc report each month going forward . thanks . if you have any questions , please call me . lisa cousino x 3 - 6343)

(0350.2000-02-05.farmer.ham.txt,Subject: some after thoughts to our meeting hi daren , i enjoyed our lunch together yesterday and believe we made a good beginning . you have very high standards for your own performance and are highly committed to the best outcome in all situations . you are likely to have high expectations for results from our coaching meetings this a good formula for success and i will do my best to honor your strengths with a focus on moving the action forward . with this in mind , i had some thoughts and additional questions for reflection following the meeting that i would like to share . you are in a transition from being a high team performer to becoming the leader of a high performing team . one of your frustrations as leader is that members of your team seem to rely too much on you to solve problems that arise in the day to day operations of the team . at first you responded to their requests for help by solving it for them , then you shifted to using questioning techniques to have them solve the problem with you . you have also offered some training to address the learnings needed to be more independent problem solvers . you are frustrated when some members of the team continue to come to you with questions they should be able to solve and when they fail to implement changes that you have trained them to use . you are seeking ways for the the team to have the same problem solving ability that they come to you for . you have recruited people with this ability and you seek to expand it in the team . this issue was the focus of our first session and needs to be the focus our next meeting . the question is : how to engage the team in solving this problem . how do i get the members of this team to own this responsibility and begin creating their own solutions ? what resources are needed by each person to contribute more to this problem ? how do i involve the team members more in the solving of this problem ? what new behaviors do i need to employ to increase the involvement of the team ? what do i need to change in myself or my relationship to the people in order to engage them more actively in the problem ? there is one dimension that i am clear about . i know that you have used performance appraisals to give feedback . have you put this issue before the team as a whole for the team to solve or have you tried to change individual team members ? i look forward to our meeting on the 17 th . keep growing ! mike teamleadership center mobile : 713 - 598 - 6732 office : 713 - 871 - 8326 fax : 713 - 871 - 1707 home : 409 - 321 - 0680 mam @ teamlead . com)

( there was actually a single user with 21 sessions ! ) we had to " bounce " the server twice to bring the system back to its normal level of performance . the good news is that we found out what caused the problem . it was not a particular user or a particular report or process . it was actually an intentional change to a specific table that we have done numerous times in the past , but this particular change had drastic side effects . we have contacted sybase with this problem to see if they can help determine if the behavior is a " feature " or a bug . in the meanwhile , we will do these types of changes at night during scheduled outages . i apologize for the frustration , anxiety , and extra work brought on by this problem and will take every precaution to see that it does not happen again . if you have any further questions or comments , please feel free to give me a call . dave n .)

" is not funny . it is not insulting . it is dumb . just imagine if folks from texas kept talking about m & a and giggling . that would not be funny . in fact , it would be retarded . that ' s why ut fans don ' t do it . please learn . 7 ) you want to lose the image of country bumpkins , of a people fond of sheep , of people that aren ' t stupid ? then quit building things that fall down . quit chasing cheerleaders around with swords on national tv . quit whooping in church . quit whooping period . quit putting up scoreboards for the enjoyment of dead mammals . quit spending your friday nights practicing how to yell . quit telling rape jokes to reporters when you ' re running for governor . when you are filling out season ticket renewals , and the form asks for your phone # , h & w , quit putting 258 - 3999 , height 6 ' 3 " , weight 185 . just , collectively , stop making asses of yourselves . go to east texas , tour every small town , and ask every red neck with a 5 th grade education why they cheer for a & m and wear maroon . that is your fan base . this is why you are perceived by the educated masses as stupid . 8 ) nobody cares if you think your band is better . they might be louder , they might march in neat little zig zags , but they have no musical ability . the point is , nobody cares who wins halftime . quit getting geeked up about marching bands . i find it hard to believe you stood through your high school band ' s entire halftime performance . and why ? cause nobody cared then and nobody cares now . plus , you can hear them fine sitting down even if you do care . why is it cool all of a sudden now that you ' re in college ? 9 ) men should never let out high pitched whooping sounds . perhaps the only justifiable situation in which this can be tolerated is perhaps during an anal probe . oh wait . . . i understand now . 10 ) dogs are not ladies . they don ' t look or smell like ladies . dogs eat their own feces and should be treated accordingly . 11 ) finally , college station is an arm - pit of a town . quit pretending that it is a great college town . it is a town and there is a college there . that should be the end of this comparison . if you feel that life doesn ' t get any better than the dixie chicken , and enjoy being stuck in a never ending " dukes of hazard " episode , then move there . more importantly , don ' t move to austin . . . . . they are trying to create an educated , technological , and open minded population base . austin is , and will continue to be , the birthplace and final resting place of all that is cool . as my friend stephen johnson once said : " if the world were ever to get an enema , college station is where you would connect the hose .

( just an fyi - ? ) do we need to get this assigned ? i can find old notes and try to get this pathed if necessary . someone just needs to let me know . lavaca expense transport - this is offsystem gas that hplc transports for ena . ena has no nom at meter 1000 in pops for jan 1 . midcon texas pipeline - there were deals left unpathed for jan 1 ( and dec ? ) . i brokered and nominated the obvious but we seem to have 10 , 000 with transport contract to move this gas on and no sale to broker to . as it stands , it looks like we have a long position . who is this assigned to ? i thought carlos was handling this one , but i could be wrong . channel industries pipeline - several issues here : 1 . all deals with the exception of the long term transport expense were left unpathed for jan 1 . i viewed prior month transactions and pathed appropriately . someone needs to review for accuracy . also , there were deals that went to zero , that were nominated for january . 2 . we still do not have enough supply to meet our sales requirement . this issue has been left unsresolved since october 99 . volume management cannot allocate was is not pathed and nominated . 3 . there is a transaction for january that is once again not on our point specific transport contracts . ( rec mtr 1 - 6366 10 , 000 to del mtr 2 - 6203 10 , 000 ) . this is a pathed pipeline . we have no rate . we need to know the rate and whether one of the expense contracts needs to be amended for this transaction , we are not legally covered . carlos was handling this pipe in dec . who is this assigned to for jan ? hpl operational - this shipper on hpl has been left unpathed for december and january 1 . who is this assigned to ? this can wait until we get back next week . if it is left unresolved , i will get it pathed when i return . pat - the following was my recollection of the assignments for dec 1 to the present . you might want to confirm with mary smith and then you can proceed with decisions that need to be made based on possible unassigned issues . hank eisenhours duties were split : mandey - handle all long term hplc expense issues : undeveloped contracts , december flow forward and cleanup of 1999 unresolved issues . carlos - all offsystem transactions for ena and hplc in unify and all offsystem paper and electronic noms on intrastate pipes . ami and stacey also handle some . there is a lot of confusion here . i found unpathed gas for december . we ' ll need to address this one quickly . hpl transports were all split by zone . each logistics rep is responsible for pathing all meters in their assigned zones in unify . hpl operational seems to be left unassigned . i think most of the desk assumed that carlos took over hanks responsibilities . the assignments above are my recollection only .)

, sally beck subject : project hurricane / bridgeline status here is a quick status and list of to do ' s related to setting up the new j . v . between enron & texaco which will be combining the lrc and bridgeline pipeline systems : summary : the lrc & bridgeline pipeline systems will be combined under the name of bridgeline llc . ownership in the jv will be split 60 % texaco & 40 % enron . bridgeline gas marketing llc will be the entity that will be trading on the pipelines under the new j . v . contracts and service agreements are in the process of being drafted . enron will be providing the trading and commercial operations systems to support this j . v . texaco will be providing the scada system . i understand that accounting is still being discussed . the trading , risk , & perhaps scheduling personnel for this jv will be initially relocated to the 21 st floor of the enron building and will eventually move to probably the 3 allen center once a more permanent spot can be built out . trading for the new jv will start in early february for march production . to do ' s : accounting : i ' ve asked jim coffey to set up two work orders to capture it transition and ongoing costs . texaco is also trying to set up a meeting next monday to step through the accounting flow so that we are all on the same page and make sure there is nothing that will fall through the cracks . pc ' s : jim fussell is in the process of ordering the pc ' s for this jv at my request . i will need the work order numbers to track these costs . networks : i ' m coordinating with arshak and his team to make sure that the voice and data networks are in place for eb 21 . once the more permanent spot is nailed down we will then need to do the same for that location . a combination of trader phones , lucent phones , stenfons and amtels have been requested . location on eb 21 : i ' m waiting on a call back from chris larson from facilities to find out what locations on 21 will be assigned to the new jv . currently half of the floor is empty but they are set up with high wall cubes . there may need to be some build out for the traders to low wall cubes . we can ' t set up the pc ' s , phones , amtels , etc until this is done . data conversion : i have requested from texaco the contract , deal and meter / facility information we will need to set up in our systems to begin trading for march production . it may be possible to get an electronic dump of this data from texaco if enron defines the data fields that we will need . we also need to set up the trading entities and portfolios . i will also need to know who will need to have access to this data so that we can set up the system security . i have received the names of the traders but i don ' t know who else will need access . interface between enron ' s unify pop ' s application and bridgeline ' s scada application : i ' ve asked dave nommensen from enron to get with carryn wright from texaco to begin the process of defining the interface between the two applications and estimate the time to build and implement the interface . there will also need to be a transition plan put in place where lrc ' s rtu ' s / efm is redirected to the bridgeline scada system . in the meantime there will be two scada systems and perhaps two gas controls until everything is merged into one . this will probably mean some manual interfaces between pop ' s and scada for confirmed noms and efm volumes until the transition is complete . scada communications : currently the lrc rtu ' s / efm communicate back to enron ' s scada system via leased lines . bridgelines rtu ' s communicate back to them via a microwave system . the new jv could save on communications costs by switching lrc ' s rtu communication to the microwave . perhaps this is best done as a part of the scada transition . accounting data needed by texaco for royalty purposes : this data needs to be better defined . i will follow up with john ledoux from texaco to get this process started . hourly volumes : bridgeline currently has one utility customer who may be billed on an hourly basis depending on the amount of swing . we need to talk through this process to see what enhancements may be needed . at least initially there will need to be some manual processes in place to support the billing for this one customer . please let me know if you ' d like to meet on any of these topics . i can have my assistant set up the meeting if needed . in the mean time i can be reached at 713 - 853 - 6858 . thanks ! - tommy)

" jimmy buffett ' s music was a big part of our lives , but even more so was the " expatriate lifestyle " he sang about . a lifestyle that includes tropical travel , sailing , boating , parasailing and surfing , and yes , the music and lyrics of mr . james w . buffett . so it is , that we created our new web site , " the expatriate zone " , along with this newsletter of that same name . in december , " the expatriate zone " opened its doors with its " island trading post " with its holiday shopping service at the " island trading post . " over 3 , 600 people visited the site the first day , and daily prizes were awarded for the first two weeks . the " island trading post " will open again soon , offering a complete line of tropical items , not just to those of us that live a few blocks from wal - mart , but also for those of us lucky enough to be on a sailboat or living on an island . for not , we ' ll start with the " t - shirt of the month . " we want " the expatriate zone " to not only keep you entertained and informed while you toil away at your everyday " corporate gig , " but it will also get you ready for that day you finally shuck it all and disappear down into " the expatriate zone . " we hope you all enjoy our new effort , and also continue to visit " parrot key " and " club st . somewhere . " both of which will be closely associated with " the expatriate zone " and " parrotkey . com . " jackson & bob - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - " expatriate of the month " james " sunny jim " white when i first ventured on the internet in 1995 , i ran in to a guy named " sunny jim " who was living down in the cayman islands . we never really got a chance to connect , for which i am truly sorry . but , when something is supposed to happen , it usually does . on the first leg of my " road dawg " tour ( click on " road dawg " ) i stayed with my good friend alex & janet leist and their wonderful children . over the five days i stayed at their house , alex and i listened to a lot of music , and one of the guys we both liked was " sunny jim . " i bought one of james ' cds from alex , and fell in love with it immediately . the cd was his second , called " life in the laid back lane . " little did i know that i would meet up with james and his roady " shady floyd " several times over the next six months . james was embarking on his first real tour of the us since he moved " down island " almost twelve years ago . we got several chances to talk over the summer , and we will have an in depth article about this " expatriate " soon on " the expatriate zone " web site . be sure to watch for it . in the meantime , here are a couple of quick things i learned about this great musician . when i asked him about his " expatriate " status , his reply was , " technically , an expatriate is someone who lives outside their own country , for whatever reason . for some it ' s legal reasons , others just because they want to , or that ' s where the work is . i have been an expatriate for nearly twelve years now . i have pretty fully lived the whole caribbean experience , from climbing the coconut trees and spear fishing , to sailing , scuba diving , hot afternoons on the beach and romantic moonlit nights under the swaying palms . " even as james is about to repatriate himself and his family , i ask if there were any other places he would consider living as an expatriate ? " maybe somewhere on the coast of mexico or in a group of islands that are all within sailing distance of one another , " was the advice he gave . until we can learn more of " sunny jim ' s " world , stop by his web site at and if you don ' t have one of his cds , including his latest release " sandbar serenade , " for goodness sake , pick one up . you can also read a great interview alex conducted with james at - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - travel into " the zone " " some are running from the irs " we strongly believe that we all have to get away from our computer screens and out into the real world as often as we can . does this mean we give up one our most useful tools of communication , computers ? heck no ! with laptops , cell phones and gps systems , we can go anywhere , and still stay in touch if we feel the need . but get real and throw that " pager " away as soon as you can . we hope to keep this section current and informative , hopefully hearing from those of you already living your lives in " the zone , " helping the rest of us prepare for our getaway from the cities . i ' m sure there are some of us that are preparing to " disappear " to places like costa rica , where the " the expatriate zone " will become an important tool . how would you like to check out a place to " disappear " to and write it off your taxes at the same time ? want to go down into " the zone " to places like the bahamas , belize , st . croix , puerto rico , bonaire , the dominica republic or saba ? want to do something for the planet , work with dolphins , save a coral reef , or study monkeys and the rain forest at the same time ? well we have the answer . check out these organization ' s web sites , and then get some advice from your financial advisor on 501 c non - profit organizations . depending on the tax bracket you ' re in , uncle sam could end up paying for up to half the trip . the oceanic society earthwatch institute reef , the reef environmental education foundation after that , all that ' s left is to make that plane reservation , and remember , " no plane on sunday . " - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - " jimmydotcom " after many delays , " jimmydotcom " has finally gone to the printer with a due date of the middle of april . i hit some " bumps in the road " on my way to publishing the first ever book about the parrot head phenomena , but it was all worth it . this book isn ' t about jimmy buffett , it ' s about the effect of the internet on parrot heads . for more information , visit . we have a complete outline of the book , reviews from other parrot heads , and samples of the pages on the site . financial considerations have limited the first printing to 1 , 000 copies at the present time , so if your even thinking of buying a book , i suggest you reserve your copy by putting your name on the " reservation list . " you will be under no financial obligation . it will simply indicate to my financial partners ( who aren ' t parrot heads ) , just how many books we need to print . do it right away , because pre - sales were brisk , and if enough of you reserve a copy , i can get the financing to expand the first printing . let ' s show the world what parrot heads stand for by making this book a big success . when i was on the bhotm tour this summer , i had many people tell me they wanted to buy an extra book to give to their boss . they wanted the boss to understand why getting the day off for a buffett concert is so important . maybe it will help the rest of us to explain ourselves to our friends " that just don ' t get it . " here ' s one of the latest reviews of the book from bob robinson , founder & president of the sandlapper phc in south carolina . i had a great time with this club on the " road dawg " tour , and shared an advance copy with his club : " when we received jackson ' s plea for pictures , our members were blown away . we hustled up a package of pix , as did a majority of the parrot head clubs from around the globe , and the result is pure parrothedonistic pleasure . this collection is bound for glory in the annals of island time . if moderation is your key to life then stay away from jimmydotcom , ' cause this book is packed with those stories only we can tell . congratulations bubbafreak !

" club trini ' s long awaited live cd will finally be coming out this april , one year after it ' s recording . jimmy has been keeping mike and robert pretty busy , so it ' s understandable that it took awhile . it will be the third in the " margaritaville cafe - late nite " series . i can ' t wait to hear it , as my wife and i were some of the lucky ones who were in new orleans when it was recorded . you can get a look at all the songs included on the new cd at club trini ' s revamped web site at . along with the great songs we ' ve become accustomed to , are a few i ' m pretty excited about . if you haven ' t heard ct ' s version of " african friend " you ' re in for a real treat . along with that , is a song that tina and nadirah have been treating audiences to this past summer , " cario " and bob marley ' s " no woman , no cry . " at the new web site , fans can " now " order their favorite club trini cds using their credit cards . so there ' s no excuse to not owning everything available . i think a true " expatriate musical library " is incomplete without club trini . this summer , helen hiatt , jimmy and the coral reefer ' s wardrobe designer , came up with a shirt that club trini members lovingly call the " ice cream vendor " shirt , which they wear out front at the start of the concert . ok , pete sometimes forgets his , and when he does have it on , it lost it ' s sleeves somewhere along the way . there ' s a great design that has been applied to a t - shirt that we all can own . check it out at their site . - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - jesters and friends note card series tro - pics has just released their first note cards series from their " jesters and friends " original oils . friends , places and musicians from past years have inspired these cards and parrot heads and expatriates alike will want to have these great looking cards for those times when an email just isn ' t personal enough . the original artwork is also on sale at this site , so be sure to stop by and visit them . included in the " jesters " series are our good friends tim glancey and wally nickel . - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - millennium change bubba style i ' ve got to tell you , i wasn ' t buying into this " new millennium " thing , one bit . in fact , i had almost decided not to go to the buffett new year ' s eve show . nothing to do with jimmy , but i just didn ' t get the whole hype . but at the last minute , i had a change of heart . and now after being a special guest at seagram ' s party honoring the new margaritaville tequila , i ' m sure glad i went . the shows kind of melded together for me , making the millennium change over very special . if you want to hear more about this or see some pictures of both , visit our new " the expatriate zone " web site at and go to the web version of this newsletter . - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - flash ! ! ! " expatriated phans " spotted south of the border after making both of " tropo travel ' s " previous trips down to cobo san lucas , mexico , i had to miss this year ' s trek due to my being with the " beach house on the moon " tour on it ' s florida , new orleans and houston swing . as the story goes , those bad boys and girls from " the expatriated phan club " showed up again , mainly for the t - shirts that said , " too much tequila . . . or not quite enough " on the back . who are those people anyway ? whenever i go to their web site , all of them have black bars covering their eyes . if you want to see pictures of the trip or need info for " down to the banana republics - 2000 " visit mike mclain also has some other great trips planned this year , check them out . speaking of " tropo travel , " if you need a hotel room for the vegas or irvine shows and want a great deal , visit there site for some great rates . i ' m joining some of my parrot head friends at the " key largo , " though i ' m kind of afraid to be in a town like vegas with sue and ponch aprea from the detroit phc . i ' m joining a lot of my other friends i met on the road there too . i hate seeing jimmy in vegas , but i ' ve got to keep the streak alive , and seeing all my parrot head friends will make it all worthwhile . i hope peter mayer ends up playing there again this year . and speaking of those great t - shirts , we have some neat shirts available at the " island store . " they ' re similar to the shirt you got if you went on this year ' s trip , except they have " tropo travel ' s " seaplane on the back and the " no bad days " logo on the front breast . you can see a picture at . - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - parrothead pilots association here are a couple of tidbits for your " airplane nuts " and pilots out there . a new online friend who ' s a medivac chopper pilot is trying to start a parrot head ' s pilot ' s association . if you ' re interested , contact dan at . i also ran across a really cool page that features jimmy ' s " hemisphere dancer " including it ' s " jamaican bullet hole .

" warning - not the same legal entity " also - beware of making contract and counterparty changes to service deals ( transport capacity , storage , cash out ) . once the deal is invalidated - there are no rules . don ' t forget - the items were locked down for a reason . if you invalidate a service deal - and change the previously locked down data that was validated - and someone used these deals in unify - it is highly likely that the unify deals and paths created using these deals will get corrupted . always check with someone from unify to make sure no one used these deals for anything in unify . - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - forwarded by thomas engel / hou / ect on 04 / 05 / 2000 09 : 47 am - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - from : scott mills on 04 / 04 / 2000 07 : 38 pm to : kathryn cordes / hou / ect @ ect , dana daigle / corp / enron @ enron , elizabeth l hernandez / hou / ect @ ect , julie meyers / hou / ect @ ect , b scott palmer / hou / ect @ ect , stephanie sever / hou / ect @ ect , dianne j swiber / hou / ect @ ect cc : steve jackson / hou / ect @ ect , thomas engel / hou / ect @ ect , sylvia a campos / hou / ect @ ect , linda s bryan / hou / ect @ ect , faye ellis / hou / ect @ ect , donna consemiu / hou / ect @ ect subject : sitara release ( re : changes in global due to consent to assignment ) with the release that was put out tuesday evening , deal validation should be able to change the counterparty on deals where the volume is something other than expected ( e . g . confirmed , nominated , scheduled , etc . ) . in addition , this release will also capture " near - time " the contract changes that are made in global . this means that need for server bounces will not be necessary . new / changes to contracts will show up without having to get out of deal manager . new counterparties , and new / changes to facilities will require getting out of all active sitara apps ( except for launch pad ) . once out of all apps , start a new app - the respective information that you are looking for will appear . i mention " near - time " because we are constrained by the amount of time it takes for the change in global data to trigger an alert for sitara who then updates its information srm ( x 33548 ) cyndie balfour - flanagan @ enron 04 / 04 / 2000 03 : 41 pm to : connie sutton / hou / ect @ ect , linda s bryan / hou / ect @ ect , kathryn cordes / hou / ect @ ect , scott mills / hou / ect @ ect , richard elwood / hou / ect @ ect , dave nommensen / hou / ect @ ect , kenneth m harmon / hou / ect @ ect , dana daigle / corp / enron @ enron , kathryn cordes / hou / ect @ ect , elizabeth l hernandez / hou / ect @ ect , julie meyers / hou / ect @ ect , b scott palmer / hou / ect @ ect , stephanie sever / hou / ect @ ect , dianne j swiber / hou / ect @ ect , gayle horn / corp / enron @ enron , brant reves / hou / ect @ ect , russell diamond / hou / ect @ ect , debbie r brackett / hou / ect @ ect , steve jackson / hou / ect @ ect cc : subject : changes in global due to consent to assignment the following changes will be made in the global contracts database due to receipt of executed consent to assignment for the following contracts : current counterparty name contract type contract # ' new ' counterparty name ces - commonwealth energy services gisb 96029892 commonwealth energy services ces - samuel gary jr . & associates , inc gisb 96029302 samuel gary jr . & associates ces - south jersey gas company gisb 96029143 south jersey gas company cp name change and contract type correction ( contract type different than that provided by ces ) per ces ces - southwest gas corporation 1 / 1 / 98 gisb 96029146 per contract file ces - southwest gas corporation 04 / 14 / 93 master purchase / sale interruptible ( will edit global # 96029146 ) & ces - southwest gas corporation 12 / 01 / 94 master sale firm ( created new global record to accommodate this k , # 96037402 ) please note that southwest gas corporation has consented to the assignment of both of these contracts .)

mentioned in our hpl staff meeting we are investigating the merits of entering into a joint venture or another transaction structure that will position hpl to effectively compete in the texas intrastate market . our primary objective is to gain access to additional sources of gas supply and achieve the required economies of scale to compete with other intrastate pipelines . i would appreciate your confidence and support in developing the optimal course of action for hpl and for enron . the skills that we have developed in our group are critical to growing our upstream origination business in n . america , as well as to the ongoing operation of hpl . our origination strategy is to leverage our business operations , field operations , engineering , producer services , and marketing skills to capture value from transportation , gathering , storage and commodity opportunities on the gas / power grids . we need our current employees to accomplish this objective across n . america . we have proven our ability to add value to enron by developing the powder / wind river pipelines , installing electric compressors , contracting for processing capacity , and establishing a new gas supply corridor along the gulf coast . our recent efforts to provide services such as business operations , measurement , trading / marketing , and accounting services to third party producers and pipelines also looks to be a promising growth opportunity . it is very important to our ongoing business relationships and our competitive position in the market place that we do not discuss hpl related matters with third parties . please come see me if you have any specific questions or concerns . also please refer any third party inquiries regarding hpl to tim determing . regards , brian)

(0872.2000-04-06.farmer.ham.txt,Subject: re : sitara release ( re : changes in global due to consent to assignment ) changing counterparty names on sitara deal tickets has absolutely no impact to any downstream processes . i hope the following will give more clarification . let me know if you have any questions or need more detail ! thanks , dg 3 - 9517 sitara / unify - process * scenario - counterparty name changes on sitara deal ticket after deal had been pathed , scheduled & bridged back from unify . * impact - zero impact to logistics & volume management , absolutely harmless . settlements has process in place to eliminate issues . * process - counterparty a in sitara changes to counterparty b . ctprty a was on original path sent to pipeline . the new name ( ctprty b ) does bridge over to unify . ctprty a remains at the path level in unify ( gui display does not change ) ctprty b is now displayed at the deal level in unify . the field is now highlighted to indicate a change occurred . ( gui display changes only at high level , not on path ) the scheduler has choice to repath ( if necessary ) , or not re - path if re - pathing occurs , the new counterparty name will be displaced on new path unify pushes back the deal number & meter to sitara ( not ctprty info ) balancing works on deal number & meter only ( not ctprty info ) the confirmation desk utilizes the information in sitara ( where all information is correct ) volume management utilizes the information in unify for pipeline tie - out . ( all information sent to pipeline is correct at the path level and will match up perfectly ) settlements utilizes information in unify . settlements recognizes that changed ctprty names changes contracts , which would create two notification entries if invoice did happen to go out to wrong ctprty , re - draft would occur . ( note : there was an issues discovered on reports which it is correcting now ) autonoms " tom ' s words of warning " - previously there was an issue when counterparty name changes took place after deals were pathed and nominated . basically it would change a key on an edi path ( duns number ) not affecting any other of the information already nominated to the pipeline . if the scheduler re - nominated , data at the pipeline would get doubled up and the scheduler would have no way to correct the problem . in most cases , the schedulers would have to get the pipeline to manually cut the original nominated volume . this is not an issue with unify ( as explained above ) .

( edi imbalance qtys would not match up to paths ) this may also cause an issue with the scheduled quantities ( especially where nominations were sent for entire month ) can ' t remember the rules on this one , but i think unify does have some safe guards ( idiot proofs ) to force re - pathing . unify does have the ability to over - ride duns numbers , yet would still cause an additional step for edi the scheduler would need to think through in order to get a clean quick response . what are ( if any ) impacts to vol mgt if counterparty name changes take place ? ( prior periods ? re - pathing ? ) i have a call into diane and dave both . after speaking w / them , hopefully i can get a clear understanding of the true impact . i am sure we ' ll need to put some processes and procedures together for deal validation to follow when these type of changes are needed . will keep you posted . thanks , dg from : thomas engel 04 / 05 / 2000 09 : 44 am to : kathryn cordes / hou / ect @ ect , dana daigle / corp / enron @ enron , elizabeth l hernandez / hou / ect @ ect , julie meyers / hou / ect @ ect , b scott palmer / hou / ect @ ect , stephanie sever / hou / ect @ ect , dianne j swiber / hou / ect @ ect , peggy hedstrom / cal / ect @ ect , dianne seib / cal / ect @ ect cc : sylvia a campos / hou / ect @ ect , linda s bryan / hou / ect @ ect , faye ellis / hou / ect @ ect , donna consemiu / hou / ect @ ect , scott mills / hou / ect @ ect , russ severson / hou / ect @ ect , martha stevens / hou / ect @ ect , karie hastings / hou / ect @ ect , regina perkins / hou / ect @ ect , imelda frayre / hou / ect @ ect , william e kasemervisz / hou / ect @ ect , hunaid engineer / hou / ect @ ect , steven gullion / hou / ect @ ect , larrissa sharma / hou / ect @ ect , donna greif / hou / ect @ ect subject : sitara release ( re : changes in global due to consent to assignment ) regarding the ability to change counterparties on deals in sitara with confirmed volumes - tom ' s words of caution : if someone calls you and wants to change a counterparty - we created the ability for you to invalidate the deal - and then change the counterparty - however - i did add a warning message : " warning - changing counterparty on deal with confirmed volumes - make sure pipeline allows this change . " some pipelines do not allow us to change counterparties after there is feedback - i assume for the same reasons we had this rule - it used to blow up our old scheduling systems ( pre - unify ) . some pipelines will require a new deal and we will have to zero out the old deal . before you make the change - make sure the logistics person is aware - just in case it causes problems with their pipeline . sorry - i don ' t know which pipes these are - you will have to ask the unify team . there is one rule still in place - you can change from ena - im east to ena - im market east - but not from ena - im texas to hplc - im hplc - when changing business units - they must be the same legal entity . " warning - not the same legal entity " also - beware of making contract and counterparty changes to service deals ( transport capacity , storage , cash out ) . once the deal is invalidated - there are no rules . don ' t forget - the items were locked down for a reason . if you invalidate a service deal - and change the previously locked down data that was validated - and someone used these deals in unify - it is highly likely that the unify deals and paths created using these deals will get corrupted . always check with someone from unify to make sure no one used these deals for anything in unify . - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - forwarded by thomas engel / hou / ect on 04 / 05 / 2000 09 : 47 am - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - from : scott mills on 04 / 04 / 2000 07 : 38 pm to : kathryn cordes / hou / ect @ ect , dana daigle / corp / enron @ enron , elizabeth l hernandez / hou / ect @ ect , julie meyers / hou / ect @ ect , b scott palmer / hou / ect @ ect , stephanie sever / hou / ect @ ect , dianne j swiber / hou / ect @ ect cc : steve jackson / hou / ect @ ect , thomas engel / hou / ect @ ect , sylvia a campos / hou / ect @ ect , linda s bryan / hou / ect @ ect , faye ellis / hou / ect @ ect , donna consemiu / hou / ect @ ect subject : sitara release ( re : changes in global due to consent to assignment ) with the release that was put out tuesday evening , deal validation should be able to change the counterparty on deals where the volume is something other than expected ( e . g . confirmed , nominated , scheduled , etc . ) . in addition , this release will also capture " near - time " the contract changes that are made in global . this means that need for server bounces will not be necessary . new / changes to contracts will show up without having to get out of deal manager . new counterparties , and new / changes to facilities will require getting out of all active sitara apps ( except for launch pad ) . once out of all apps , start a new app - the respective information that you are looking for will appear . i mention " near - time " because we are constrained by the amount of time it takes for the change in global data to trigger an alert for sitara who then updates its information srm ( x 33548 ) cyndie balfour - flanagan @ enron 04 / 04 / 2000 03 : 41 pm to : connie sutton / hou / ect @ ect , linda s bryan / hou / ect @ ect , kathryn cordes / hou / ect @ ect , scott mills / hou / ect @ ect , richard elwood / hou / ect @ ect , dave nommensen / hou / ect @ ect , kenneth m harmon / hou / ect @ ect , dana daigle / corp / enron @ enron , kathryn cordes / hou / ect @ ect , elizabeth l hernandez / hou / ect @ ect , julie meyers / hou / ect @ ect , b scott palmer / hou / ect @ ect , stephanie sever / hou / ect @ ect , dianne j swiber / hou / ect @ ect , gayle horn / corp / enron @ enron , brant reves / hou / ect @ ect , russell diamond / hou / ect @ ect , debbie r brackett / hou / ect @ ect , steve jackson / hou / ect @ ect cc : subject : changes in global due to consent to assignment the following changes will be made in the global contracts database due to receipt of executed consent to assignment for the following contracts : current counterparty name contract type contract # ' new ' counterparty name ces - commonwealth energy services gisb 96029892 commonwealth energy services ces - samuel gary jr . & associates , inc gisb 96029302 samuel gary jr . & associates ces - south jersey gas company gisb 96029143 south jersey gas company cp name change and contract type correction ( contract type different than that provided by ces ) per ces ces - southwest gas corporation 1 / 1 / 98 gisb 96029146 per contract file ces - southwest gas corporation 04 / 14 / 93 master purchase / sale interruptible ( will edit global # 96029146 ) & ces - southwest gas corporation 12 / 01 / 94 master sale firm ( created new global record to accommodate this k , # 96037402 ) please note that southwest gas corporation has consented to the assignment of both of these contracts .)

( it is currently still under hplr ) . if this gas is not nominated on the above transport agreement , then once again we need to accomodate the flow volume on the hpl pipe with either a point nom or a sitara deal at meters 415 and 9643 .)

(4830.2001-08-17.farmer.ham.txt,Subject: new enrononline functionality in order to continually develop and make improvements to the functionality of enrononline we are rolling out several changes tonight , which will be in effect on monday august 20 , 2001 . some of these changes will affect stack manager while others affect the website . a summary of these changes is listed below . stack manager changes top of stack limit orders - this feature will allow the price submitted via limit orders to be displayed on the website if their bid or offer is better than the trader ' s stack price . stack manger will list the price and the names of counterparties submitting such orders on the floated stack window . orders will be queued by price and time stamp . when a counterparty trades on a " top of stack entry " it will create back to back transactions ; one between enron and the counterparty submitting the order , and the other between enron and the counterparty clicking on the website . in order to turn on this functionality select the " allowed top of stack " option , in the orders section of the product properties page . if regular limit order functionality is desired the " allowed " option should be selected . please note that this feature will be released in a disabled mode and will be turned on sometime next week after determining which business units want to roll this out . restricted top of stack limit orders - this feature will allow the price submitted only by internal traders via limit orders to be displayed on the website if their bid or offer is better than the trader ' s stack price . stack manger will list price and the names of counterparties submitting such orders on the floated stack window . orders will be queued by price and time stamp . when a counterparty trades on a " top of stack entry " it will create back to back transactions one between enron and the counterparty submitting the order , and the other between enron and the counterparty clicking on the website . in order to turn on this functionality select the " allowed as restricted top of stack " option , in the orders section of the product properties page . if regular limit order functionality is desired the " allowed " option should be selected . if a product has active orders against it you will not be able to select the " restricted top of stack " feature . advanced filtering ability on all products tab - drop down filtering capability is now available for each field in the all products tab in stack manager . in order to filter click on the arrow next to the field title . a drop down box with a list of attributes will appear . highlight the attribute by which you wish to filter . to turn off the filter click on the arrow and select the " all " option from the drop down box . website changes new submission screen for restricted top of stack limit orders - the submission screen for products that allow top of stack or restricted top of stack limit orders is as follows . the submit button on the left makes a submission for a normal transaction , while the button on the right will submit as a limit order . in case of the restricted top of stack limit orders only internal traders will see the new submission box . price of limit orders modify limit orders customers now have the ability to modify the price of any active order . in order to do so highlight the order to be modified and use the plus or minus sign next to the price field on at the top of the " today ' s orders " section . the price will move up or down in the same increments as the tick size for that product . once the price is at the desired level click the " set " button and the price will be modified . another way to modify the price on a limit order is to click on the price field on a particular limit order . you will see a box with plus , minus and set buttons that allow you to modify that order . expiration time for limit orders customers can now place limit orders with expiration times of up to 30 days . currently they may place orders for only up to 12 hours . float the today ' s orders section you can now float the " limit order " section . in order to do so , right click in the " today ' s orders " section and select the float window option . in order to make the window " stay on top " right click on the floated window and select the stay on top option . mid market client - mid market originators will now have the ability to transact on behalf of their customers , while including their desired margin on the trade , on enrononline products . in order to do so click on the bid or offer price , a customised submission window will appear . select the counterparty for whom you wish to transact from a drop down list , enter the desired customer price and margin and click submit . for example if a customer wants to buy nymex sep 01 at 3 . 36 and you wish to have a 1 cent margin , please enter 3 . 36 as the desired price and 0 . 01 as the margin . the system will trade the order when the enrononline offer for nymex sep 01 is at 3 . 35 , book the trade at 3 . 36 and record the 0 . 01 origination amount . in order to be set up to use this functionality . please call the enrononline product control group . changes to website passwords - as an added security measure , which has been requested by many customers , some new password rules have been instituted . first , the password cannot be equal to the login id . second , each user will be prompted to change his password every 90 days . these rules apply to all website passwords for both internal and external users . please note stack manager changes will be available all traders as of monday august 20 , 2001 . the changes to the website will be rolled out to a few internal users on monday with the rest of the internal users being upgraded monday night , and external users by the end of the week . over the next couple of weeks all users will be prompted to change their website passwords . if you have any questions regarding these changes please contact me at 713 -

(0161.2000-01-10.farmer.ham.txt,Subject: marketing services / scheduling daren , thinking about robert ' s little memo yesterday and along the lines of pulling the marketing ( sitara ) function back to your side of the fence i think a strong case could be made in favor of that idea . it is obvious that several people are involved in changing tickets , pathing , nominating , and confirming the industrials . this dissipates the knowledge base and the responsibility factor . it is a " who ' s on first " issue . if the responsibility to ensure pricing , volume , and accomplishment of market intent is accurately depicted , and in sitara , is in your shop then the schedulers could concentrate on the accuracy and correctness of unify and pops . i ' m sure this would help volume management and client services immensely . as the skill level rises in this area you could then gradually feed more and more of the marketing function ( sitara ) to the scheduling group in the hopes they would then have a better understanding of the overhaul picture . i believe the current situation is too much , too fast , for scheduling to handle all at once . it has also created a situation where robert seems to think not only that he has all the segments mastered , but that he is the only person that should be involved in the industrials . i will support whatever direction you want to go on this issue , but if you and pat leave things the way they are please explain to both robert and pat that others may be involved in the industrial activity and that is quite alright . once again , thanks for listening . ken - attl . htm)

' s creditors have apparently filed motions to delay the scheduled auction of the company ' s trading assets this week , but one - time merger partner and creditor dynegy corp . will not be one of them , a spokesman said wednesday . however , whether the auction proceeds as planned , enron is facing more obstacles on the legal front with 51 subpoenas requesting documents expected to be issued friday by the senate ' s permanent subcommittee on investigations . the u . s . bankruptcy court for the southern district of new york has been asked by the creditors to delay approving any offer for enron ' s trading business , once the most profitable unit of the company . the motion to delay was requested to allow the creditors time to look at the assets up for sale . included in the auction are assets from its enrononline operation , which enron would like to use in a joint venture with a cash - rich company . under enron ' s proposal , a 51 % joint venture partner would form a new company with enron to be called new energy trading co . , or netco . enron would contribute information technology and back office systems among other things , in exchange for a 49 % stake . as of late monday , ubs ag , citigroup inc . and bp had made bids for some of the assets . among those opposing the auction , now set for thursday with a decision on the winning bids as early as friday , is the royal bank of scotland group plc , which said , " absent a disclosure of the intended uses for the proceeds of this sale , the creditors are unable to gauge that the benefits are adequate , appropriate and directed to the proper beneficiaries . " kansas city , mo - based aquila also is opposed to the auction because of concerns about how the proceeds would be used . aquila wants the auction ' s proceeds put in escrow until it is determined which units of enron receive the money . however , dynegy does not plan to oppose the auction , said company spokesman steve stengel , who also expressed surprise that any company would want to delay it . " dynegy has not taken any action to delay the sale of enron ' s trading business , " he told ngi . stengel also confirmed that the scheduled sale of northern natural gas co . from enron to dynegy is still set to close by the end of january . still to come is word on who and what documents are being subpoenaed by the senate ' s permanent subcommittee on investigations . the subpoenas will be served on enron , its accounting firm andersen and 49 individual officers , employees and members of the board of directors . the subcommittee is one of five congressional panels investigating the fallen giant along with the u . s . securities and exchange commission , the department of labor and the department of justice . " the subcommittee is looking into the role of the officers and board members , the role of the auditors , and the role of special - purpose entities , " a subcommittee spokesman told reuters . these are some of the same types of things being investigated by the house of representatives financial services committee , the senate commerce committee and the house and senate energy committees . the spokesman said the subpoenas would allow enron and the others " several weeks " to respond .)

" coach slocum and i made the decision to be a part of this exciting venture with espn , " texas a & m athletics director wally groff said . " we couldn ' t be more thrilled that espn has chosen texas a & m for this series . the opportunity espn gave us to showcase this wonderful institution and all of its tradition and heritage is something we could not pass up . " in a " docu - drama " style , the various stories that surround the team will be explored through the voices and actions of people whose day - to - day lives are directly affected by living in the town and / or going to the school . players and coaches will also be visible and heard from in a more peripheral fashion , but will not be the primary focus . " this is a good opportunity for texas a & m university and we ' re delighted espn decided to feature the football program and some of the people behind the scenes , " head coach r . c . slocum said . " we look forward to working with them . " the participants will be drawn from a cross section of people who reflect every aspect of the university and college station , texas . they will be students , faculty , media , local storeowners , mothers , fathers and some of the high school seniors who aspire to attend the university . " each person has a role to play with the team , as well as a personal story , " said mark shapiro , vice president and general manager , espn original entertainment . " sidelines will see each person grow in character as the season progresses - - a kind of ' soap - umentary . ' we ' ll weave the smaller personal stories together through the bigger story of the progression and fate of the team and its season . " sidelines : texas a & m storylines - - this is the 125 th anniversary of the school ' s founding ( 1876 ) . - - the community is still very much dealing with the 1999 bonfire collapse which tragically killed 12 students almost two years ago . a 90 - year tradition came to a tumultuous end . dealing with the loss and the emotional toll it took on faculty members , students and families will be an important part of this series . the bonfire will return in 2002 but will take on a different form than has been tradition . - - texas a & m , who lost a wild , snowy independence bowl last year in overtime to mississippi state 43 - 41 , will play notre dame ( at home ) , texas , oklahoma , kansas st and colorado next year . a tough schedule will provide for great drama . - - the school invented the phrase " 12 th man " and actually owns the trademark . one game , the aggies were low on players and had a student suit up and stand ready just in case he was needed . ever since , a student is chosen for every home game to suit up and play on the kickoff team . - - billy pickard is in charge of maintaining the facilities . he ' s been at the university for 36 years and was the student trainer for bear bryant ' s a & m team . he was actually in junction , texas for bryant ' s infamous grueling summer camp . the story of it was a best - selling book , the junction boys . - - at midnight on the friday night before every home game , a " 30 , 000 fans show up each week for this time - honored tradition . eoe , the newest franchise of espn programming , will develop a wide - variety of branded programming outside of the network ' s traditional event and sports news genres . using a collection of vehicles - - game shows , documentaries or reality - based shows - it ' s espn ' s goal to broaden its audience by appealing to younger and casual sports fans . in addition , the company is exploring new ways to connect with consumers by applying these projects across all platforms of the espn family - television , internet , radio - atm -)

(4933.2001-09-26.farmer.ham.txt,Subject: proposed rule extends marketing affiliate regulations to all affiliates ngi ' s daily gas price index breaking news : posted sep 26 , 4 : 16 pm proposed rule extends marketing affiliate regulations to all affiliates federal energy regulatory commissioners wednesday agreed to issue a notice of proposed rulemaking broadening the application of standards of conduct for transmission providers , including both natural gas pipelines and power lines , to require separation of the regulated monopolies from any other company affiliate . previously , the rules simply required creation of a firewall , including separate operations in separate locations staffed by separate personnel , between gas pipelines and their marketing affiliates . the proposed rule would wall off both gas and electric transmission operations from any other affiliate , gas or electric , including financial affiliates . the commission was presented with two options regarding the application of the proposed rule to electric transmission affiliates , which still in many cases have bundled operations . one option would enforce complete separation , while a second would have exempted employees who deal in sales or purchases of bundled retail native load . staff and commissioners wood , william massey and nora brownell appeared to favor walling off all affiliated personnel , so they would not be privy to market information about transmission operations that other non - affiliated competitors did not have access to . commissioner linda breathitt , however , argued for exempting personnel dealing solely with retail native load . breathitt said that while she supported the eventual separation of the entities , she was concerned about the timing . " i see no compelling reason at this time ; there have been no complaints and no evidence . " she said she thought state commissions might consider the move an infringement on their jurisdiction . " i agree with concept philosophically , but i think there will be other opportunities later on , after we do a little more bridge - building with state commissions . " wood said he understood " the political issue here with respect to federal - state relations , but i think this is an opportunity for discrimination that ought to be eliminated . " staff pointed out that if there were any problems with transmission reliability or if some small utilities had problems , waivers could be granted . staff was questioned by the commissioners as to how much information was available to affiliate personnel . " if i am an affiliate employee dealing solely with retail native load , i can go into the control room and get all the information i want , " one staffer responded . wood proposed , and the commissioners ratified , a proposed rule with no exceptions , but which makes clear that in the final rule the commission may reverse field and determine that separation of employees dealing with sales of native load is not required . commenting parties should provide cost / benefit analysis on both sides of the question . state commissions are also invited to comment . wood had suggested the commission extend the separation to all sales employees , " but make it clear that if we don ' t hear from people that they really want this separation , we ain ' t going to do it .

[ 65 , 229 ] in both cases , the commission rejected rate design features where there was no evidence in the record showing that the rate design features reflected cost incurrence , id . in its order setting this proceeding for hearing , the commission took note of edison ' s proposed seasonal differential and specifically directed that the parties fully address the issues related to the cost support for the seasonal rate design , commission order issued march 30 , 1979 , mimeo at 4 - 5 . on october 9 , 1980 , the parties were directed by the presiding judge to identify in their initial briefs the portions of the record that relate to cost support for the seasonal differential . the requirement that edison provide cost support for its seasonal differential , as discussed supra , is also set forth in the commission ' s filing requirements for rate schedules : if the rate design is intended to reflect costs , the applicant must show how it reflects costs ; if the rate design is not intended to reflect costs , the applicant must justify the departure from costbased rates , 18 cfr o 35 . 13 ( b ) ( 4 ) ( iii ) statement p . edison ' s seasonal differential is intended to lessen the costs imposed upon it by its prominent summer peak . edison reasons that , since it must build capacity to meet its prominent summer peak , charging more in the summer would give customers an incentive to control their summer demands and , therefore , edison ' s cost of adding capacity would be reduced ( tr . 169 ) . accordingly , edison must show how its seasonal differential reflects the costs imposed on it by summer demand , under the commission ' s filing requirements in 18 cfr o 35 . 13 ( b ) ( 4 ) ( iii ) statement p . further , even purpa section 111 ( d ) ( 4 ) relied upon by edison states that rates " shall be on a seasonal basis which reflects the costs of providing service to such class of consumers at different seasons of the year to the extent that such costs vary seasonally for such utility . " ( emphasis added . ) further , support for relying on marginal rather than average costs comes from the commission itself . in its order of march 30 , 1979 setting this cause for hearing , mimeo at 4 , 5 , the commission , in commenting on time of day and seasonal rates , mentioned that it encourage innovative rate design to match more closely rates to costs . in this regard , the commission cited its order no . 537 , supra at 4 , which specifically suggests use of pricing mechanisms based on marginal cost principles [ 65 , 236 ] for jurisdictional wholesale sales . under the circumstances in this case , where the sale of economy energy is related to edison ' s costs in adding or eliminating additional excess capacity , it is appropriate to establish the price for economy transactions on marginal costs . this provides a more close matching of the rate to the cost than would a rate design based on average costs . accordingly , winnetka ' s position on pricing of economy energy will not be adopted . affirmed and reversed - see next paragraph comm - opinion - order , 23 ferc ? 61 , 219 , commonwealth edison company , docket nos . er 79 - 182 - 000 and er 80 - 106 - 000 , ( may 12 , 1983 ) turning to commonwealth ' s exceptions , we find that the judge correctly rejected the seasonal differential . even if we accept the company ' s interpretation of purpa , it still has not cited any record evidence whatsoever of a difference in costs between summer and nonsummer months . without at least some showing of a cost difference , it is impossible to make a judgment on the reasonableness of the company ' s 15 . 25 % proposal . we therefore uphold the judge on this point . we reverse the judge ' s adoption of a price set at 110 % of the utility ' s incremental costs , however , and approve the type - b split - savings method proposed by commonwealth . under this method , economy transactions are arranged for a 12 - hour or similar period at a fixed price based on cost estimates at the time of the agreement . if the utility ' s incremental costs rise to the point that continued supply would become burdensome , the utility may terminate supply . we find this method superior to that proposed by staff in that implementation is greatly simplified . cost determinations need not be made as frequently . related to pmas reg - preamble , fercsr ? 36 , 710 , procedures for public participation in power and transmission rate adjustments and extensions , december 31 , 1980 , 10 cfr 903 , 45 fr 86976 [ 36 , 741 ] historically , many purpa - type standards have been used in designing wholesale rates for the sale of federal hydroelectric power . pmas analyze costs to establish revenue requirements and consider this information in designing rates . declining block rates for energy were once used by the pmas but subsequently were found inappropriate and eliminated from rate schedules . many of the pmas for years have been effectively using various forms of load management measures in their rate schedules , such as scheduling limitations , loadshaping , capacity and energy overrun charges , etc . bpa has had a history of using seasonal rates for wholesale firm capacity and energy and also offered its direct service industrial customers interruptible rates some time ago . southwestern has had interruptible capacity rates in effect since 1957 . these examples demonstrate the willingness of the pmas to implement purpa - type standards where applicable . many of these purpa - type standards , when applied appropriately in the design of pma rates , can serve to implement the purposes of purpa by encouraging conservation of energy , efficient use of resources and facilities , and equitable rates . the public participation process will provide an opportunity to examine these and other appropriate concepts . the pmas will continue to review and revise their power marketing practices on a system - by - system basis to serve the purpa objectives . the assistant secretary for resource applications , working with the administrators of the power administrations , and after receiving public comment , will consider the adoption of rate design guidelines , similar in form to the guidelines in ra 6120 . 2 on financial accounting and ratemaking , which will reflect the experience gained by the pmas in their system - by - system approach to rate design . related to purpa fed - law , fercsr ? 5021 , purpa , sec . 111 . consideration and determination respecting certain ratemaking standards . ( 4 ) seasonal rates . - - the rates charged by an electric utility for providing electric service to each class of electric consumers shall be on a seasonal basis which reflects the costs of providing service to such class of consumers at different seasons of the year to the extent that such costs vary seasonally for such utility . fed - reg - notice , fercsr ? 37 , 503 , doe responsibilities under title i of purpa ( 4 ) seasonal rates shall be established where costs vary by season ; prop - reg - preamble , fercsr 1988 - 1998 ? 32 , 457 , administrative determination of full avoided costs , sales of power to qualifying facilities , and inter - connection facilities , march 16 , 1988 , docket no . rm 88 - 6 - 000 , 53 fr 9331 , 55 fr 31882 pricing flexibility may take several different forms . for instance , a contract could provide qfs with a price floor applicable to all the power supplied to the utility , but still provide for higher variable unit prices reflecting daily or seasonal periods . the price floor would provide the revenue stream necessary for the qf to secure financial support while [ 32 , 174 ] the price variability would induce the qf to maximize deliveries in peak - load periods when the utility values additional supplies most . of course , the price floor should not exceed the minimum value of the utility ' s avoided cost . similarly , a contract could provide for a two part price - - a fixed payment for capacity and an energy price for power delivered . the qf would be assured a minimum revenue stream based on the value of its capacity . the variable energy component would allow the utility to dispatch the qf capacity only when it was economic . whatever the pattern of contract payments , rates for purchases from qfs should always reflect how well the characteristics of the suppliers ' power match the purchasing utility ' s need . this will ensure that the qf will make most production decisions on the basis of rates reflecting avoided costs ( rather than the guaranteed average rate ) and , at the same time , will receive revenues sufficient to attract investors . to avoid problems such as those associated with take - or - pay contracts in the natural gas industry , the commission wishes to stress the danger of including forecasted fuel costs in the fixed rate structure of long - term contracts , especially in combination with the specification of minimum purchase quantities . the commission also encourages the use of time - of - day and seasonal rates in flexible pricing structures for long - term contracts . reg - preamble , fercsr 1977 - 1981 ? 30 , 128 , small power production and cogeneration facilities ; regulations implementing section 210 of the public utility regulatory policies act of 1978 , order no . 69 , february 25 , 1980 , docket no . rm 79 - 55 , 18 cfr 292 , 45 fr 12214 , 45 fr . . . rather than specifying that exact time - of - day or seasonal rates for purchases are required , however , the commission believes that the selection of a methodology is best left to the state regulatory authorities and nonregulated electric utilities charged with the implementation of these provisions .)

(3776.2001-03-13.farmer.ham.txt,Subject: california energy crisis california ' s power crisis has generated heated debate over the last several months . unfortunately , this debate has generated more heat than light . we want you to know what the facts are and what we are doing about the crisis . please spend a few minutes reading the following overview on the situation and our position on california energy issues . what happened in california the source of california ' s current problem is as straightforward as supply and demand . california ' s economy grew 29 percent since 1998 . this increased the demand for electricity by 24 percent . at the same time , regulatory restrictions prevented new generation from getting built in the state . so demand grew but regulations prevented supplies from being added . the result , predictably , is a shortage . this summer , peak capacity will be about 10 percent shy of peak demand , leading to further blackouts in the state . in addition to the supply and demand imbalance , there are two other related factors that led to the current crisis . first , the state ' s regulations forced all sales and purchases into the spot market . the spot market for power is extraordinarily volatile . the way firms behave in a free market when faced with such volatility is to construct a portfolio of purchases long term , medium term and short term , to reduce exposure to this volatility . in california , state regulation prevented this strategy . this would be the equivalent of putting the entire state on an adjustable rate mortgage in the most volatile interest rate environment imaginable . everything was fine while the power surplus persisted , but when shortages ensued , every megawatt was purchased at the sky rocketing spot price . second , retail markets were not deregulated . regulated retail rates remained in effect , and stranded cost recovery charges were structured to keep competition out . this meant that utilities were forced to pay high wholesale prices in the spot market but were only able to recover costs at the regulated retail rate . they are now nearly bankrupt . in short , california ' s problems were caused by regulation , not deregulation . regulations prevented competitors from entering the market , prevented new generation from being built , and prevented prudent hedging against volatile spot prices . at the time california was developing its restructuring plan , enron warned the state ' s policy makers about these risks and proposed alternatives , which , if adopted , would have averted the current crisis . enron ' s role many political leaders in the state have elected to fix blame rather than fix the problem . power sellers , including enron , have been vilified by the politicians and the media . here are the facts : ? other than a small amount of wind power , enron is not a generator in the state of california . every megawatt we sold in california we bought in the same market available to other california purchasers . because we are a market maker , not a generator , we are not biased toward high prices . we are interested only in having a market that works so that we can package products for our customers . ? as a seller to end - use markets in the state , we provided protection from the problems the states ' utilities , and their customers , now face . we protected , and still protect , our customers from price volatility . you may have read that ees recently elected to have the utilities supply power directly to its customers in california instead of procuring power on the open market . early reports mischaracterized this as a " turnback " of our customers to the utilities . here are the facts : ? as a result of a variety of factors existing in the current california market , it made more sense for ees to source power for its customers directly from the utilities . this decision reduced ees ' s market price risk by allowing ees to access lower utility rates . ? ees did not terminate any customer contracts , and our customers continue to receive the financial benefits of their contract prices . ? ees is continuing to work with its california customers to provide them with other energy - related products and services , including assistance in reducing the demand for power , particularly at peak times . enron is currently proposing solutions to help california work out of its crisis ; enron continues to sign up customers in the state ; and enron continues to actively manage its risks and capture opportunities in western power markets . enron ' s primary business is managing risk for our customers with solutions customized to meet their needs . there has never been more demand for our products and services . the solution the solution to california ' s crisis is also straightforward . in summary , the state must increase supply , reduce demand , reduce reliance on the spot market and shore up the financial stability of the state ' s utilities . increasing supply california ' s process for siting and permitting new generation is nothing short of byzantine . enron has built plants elsewhere in the country in less than a year . in california , it often takes 5 to 7 years . california simply must streamline this process . ironically , while many of the regulations generators must overcome are aimed at improving environmental quality , the regulations are preventing new clean technology from coming online and displacing current plants , which emit 40 times as much nox . california can have abundant power and cleaner air by expediting the permitting of new facilities . reducing demand customers in california today have no incentive to reduce or shift demand . they pay the same rate no matter what the market price is . an open retail market would trigger demand responses , which would balance supply and demand at lower prices than today . california should fully open its retail market . reducing reliance on the spot market in a truly deregulated market , customers would protect themselves from volatile spot prices by purchasing some of their requirements on a longer term , fixed - price basis . the state has instead left procurement in the hands of the utilities , which it has forced to buy exclusively in the spot market . opening the market at the retail level will give customers control over their price risk . restoring the financial integrity of the state ' s institutions the utilities in california are not paying their bills . this has led to greater uncertainty in the market , higher costs , and reduced flexibility to arrive at lasting solutions . california must permit its utilities to recover their costs so they can pay their bills and invest in the transmission and distribution assets necessary to get power from where it is to where it is needed . just as important as doing these things , the state must avoid policies that , while politically attractive , do not fix the problem or even make matters worse . price caps have been proposed . they don ' t work ; have never worked ; and they will not work here . price caps succeed only in creating shortages , which then have to be allocated among competing users . imagine how ineffectively the government would be in determining , for example , whether it is better to make its limited power supplies available to the imperial valley or silicon valley . price caps are a surefire way to make the current shortage worse . the state has also proposed to take over generation and transmission in california . there is no reason to believe , and every reason to doubt , that the state will be more effective than free markets at investing in , constructing , operating and maintaining assets . this will also result in california tax revenues being spent on power transmission and power generation - - which the private sector can do - - instead of education , roads and other public goods - - which the private sector cannot do . as you are approached by people outside the company or are learning about the crisis from the media , it ' s important for you to know this : we at enron will continue to serve our customers and we will continue to propose real solutions to the state .)

all christmas programs and christmas carols from public schools ! ! you as a christian can help ! we are praying for at least 1 million signatures . this would defeat their effort and how that there are many christians alive , well and concerned about our country . as christians we must unite on this . please don ' t take this lightly . we ignored this lady once and lost prayer in our school and

(3775.2001-03-13.farmer.ham.txt,Subject: california energy crisis california  , s power crisis has generated heated debate over the last several months . unfortunately , this debate has generated more heat than light . we want you to know what the facts are and what we are doing about the crisis . please spend a few minutes reading the following overview on the situation and our position on california energy issues . what happened in california the source of california  , s current problem is as straightforward as supply and demand . california  , s economy grew 29 percent since 1998 . this increased the demand for electricity by 24 percent . at the same time , regulatory restrictions prevented new generation from getting built in the state . so demand grew but regulations prevented supplies from being added . the result , predictably , is a shortage . this summer , peak capacity will be about 10 percent shy of peak demand , leading to further blackouts in the state . in addition to the supply and demand imbalance , there are two other related factors that led to the current crisis . first , the state  , s regulations forced all sales and purchases into the spot market . the spot market for power is extraordinarily volatile . the way firms behave in a free market when faced with such volatility is to construct a portfolio of purchases long term , medium term and short term , to reduce exposure to this volatility . in california , state regulation prevented this strategy . this would be the equivalent of putting the entire state on an adjustable rate mortgage in the most volatile interest rate environment imaginable . everything was fine while the power surplus persisted , but when shortages ensued , every megawatt was purchased at the sky rocketing spot price . second , retail markets were not deregulated . regulated retail rates remained in effect , and stranded cost recovery charges were structured to keep competition out . this meant that utilities were forced to pay high wholesale prices in the spot market but were only able to recover costs at the regulated retail rate . they are now nearly bankrupt . in short , california  , s problems were caused by regulation , not deregulation . regulations prevented competitors from entering the market , prevented new generation from being built , and prevented prudent hedging against volatile spot prices . at the time california was developing its restructuring plan , enron warned the state  , s policy makers about these risks and proposed alternatives , which , if adopted , would have averted the current crisis . enron  , s role many political leaders in the state have elected to fix blame rather than fix the problem . power sellers , including enron , have been vilified by the politicians and the media . here are the facts : ? other than a small amount of wind power , enron is not a generator in the state of california . every megawatt we sold in california we bought in the same market available to other california purchasers . because we are a market maker , not a generator , we are not biased toward high prices . we are interested only in having a market that works so that we can package products for our customers . ? as a seller to end - use markets in the state , we provided protection from the problems the states  , utilities , and their customers , now face . we protected , and still protect , our customers from price volatility . you may have read that ees recently elected to have the utilities supply power directly to its customers in california instead of procuring power on the open market . early reports mischaracterized this as a  enron continues to sign up customers in the state ; and enron continues to actively manage its risks and capture opportunities in western power markets . enron  , s primary business is managing risk for our customers with solutions customized to meet their needs . there has never been more demand for our products and services . the solution the solution to california  , s crisis is also straightforward . in summary , the state must increase supply , reduce demand , reduce reliance on the spot market and shore up the financial stability of the state  , s utilities . increasing supply california  , s process for siting and permitting new generation is nothing short of byzantine . enron has built plants elsewhere in the country in less than a year . in california , it often takes 5 to 7 years . california simply must streamline this process . ironically , while many of the regulations generators must overcome are aimed at improving environmental quality , the regulations are preventing new clean technology from coming online and displacing current plants , which emit 40 times as much nox . california can have abundant power and cleaner air by expediting the permitting of new facilities . reducing demand customers in california today have no incentive to reduce or shift demand . they pay the same rate no matter what the market price is . an open retail market would trigger demand responses , which would balance supply and demand at lower prices than today . california should fully open its retail market . reducing reliance on the spot market in a truly deregulated market , customers would protect themselves from volatile spot prices by purchasing some of their requirements on a longer term , fixed - price basis . the state has instead left procurement in the hands of the utilities , which it has forced to buy exclusively in the spot market . opening the market at the retail level will give customers control over their price risk . restoring the financial integrity of the state  , s institutions the utilities in california are not paying their bills . this has led to greater uncertainty in the market , higher costs , and reduced flexibility to arrive at lasting solutions . california must permit its utilities to recover their costs so they can pay their bills and invest in the transmission and distribution assets necessary to get power from where it is to where it is needed . just as important as doing these things , the state must avoid policies that , while politically attractive , do not fix the problem or even make matters worse . price caps have been proposed . they don  , t work ; have never worked ; and they will not work here . price caps succeed only in creating shortages , which then have to be allocated among competing users . imagine how ineffectively the government would be in determining , for example , whether it is better to make its limited power supplies available to the imperial valley or silicon valley . price caps are a surefire way to make the current shortage worse . the state has also proposed to take over generation and transmission in california . there is no reason to believe , and every reason to doubt , that the state will be more effective than free markets at investing in , constructing , operating and maintaining assets . this will also result in california tax revenues being spent on power transmission and power generation - - which the private sector can do - - instead of education , roads and other public goods - - which the private sector cannot do . as you are approached by people outside the company or are learning about the crisis from the media , it  , s important for you to know this : we at enron will continue to serve our customers and we will continue to propose real solutions to the state .)

" it has always been the custom at roane county high school football games to say a prayer and play the national anthem to honor god and country . due to a recent ruling by the supreme court , i am told that saying a prayer is a violation of federal case law . as i understand the law at this time , i can use this public facility to approve of sexual perversion and call it an alternate lifestyle , and if someone is offended , that ' s ok . i can use it to condone sexual promiscuity by dispensing condoms and calling it safe sex . if someone is offended , that ' s ok . i can even use this public facility to present the merits of killing an unborn baby as a viable means of birth control . if someone is offended , no problem . i can designate a school day as earth day and involve students in activities to religiously worship and praise the goddess , mother earth , and call it ecology . i can use literature , videos and presentations in the classroom that depict people with strong , traditional christian convictions as simple minded and ignorant and call it enlightenment . however , if anyone uses this facility to honor god and ask him to bless this event with safety and good sportsmanship , federal case law is violated . this appears to be inconsistent at best , and at worst , diabolical . apparently , we are to be tolerant of everything and anyone except god and his commandments . nevertheless , as a school principal , i frequently ask staff and students to abide by rules which they do not necessarily agree . for me to do otherwise would be inconsistent at best , and at worst , hypocritical . i suffer from that affliction enough unintentionally . i certainly do not need to add an intentional transgression . for this reason , i shall , " render unto caesar that which is caesar ' s , " and refrain from praying at this time . however , if you feel inspired to honor , praise and thank god , and ask him in the name of jesus to bless this event , please feel free to do so . as far as i know , that ' s not against the law - yet . " and . . . one by one , the people in the stands bowed their heads , held hands with one another , and began to pray . they prayed in the stands . they prayed in the team huddles . they prayed at the concession stand . and they prayed in the announcer ' s box . the only place they didn ' t pray was in the supreme court of the united states of america - the seat of " justice " in the one nation under god . somehow , kingston , tennessee , remembered what so many have forgotten . . . we are given the freedom of religion , not the freedom from religion . praise god that his remnant remains ! let ' s celebrate jesus in 2001 jesus said , " if you are ashamed of me , i will be ashamed of you before my father . " - - - - - - - - - if you are not ashamed , pass this on . . . but only if you mean it . yes , i do love god . he is my source of existence and savior . he keeps me functioning each and every day . without him , i will be nothing . without him , i am nothing but with him , i can do all things through christ that strengthens me . phil 4 : 13 geoff gayle synergy oil & gas , inc . office : ( 713 ) 461 - 6626 x . 113 fax : ( 713 ) 461 - 4475 email : ggayle @ synergyog . com to unsubscribe , write to - unsubscribe @ listbot . com)
