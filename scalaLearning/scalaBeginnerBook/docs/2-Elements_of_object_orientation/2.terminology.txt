-Class
    -> A class defines a combination of data and procedures.
        Instances of other classes can only access that data or those procedures
        through specified interfaces.

    -> A class is a template when creating new instances, a class does not hold any data but specifies
        the data that is held in the instance

-Subclass
    -> Class that inherits from another class, subclasses are also classes in their own right, and as a class
        can have any number of subclasses

-Superclass
    -> A superclass is the parent of a class. Is the class from which the current class inherits.

-Instance or Object:
    -> An instance is an example of a class. All instances of a class possess the same data variables but contain their own data.

- Instance variable:
    -> This is the special name given to the data which is held by an object. The 'state' of an object at any particular moment
        relates to the current values held by its instance variables, in Scala there are also class-side variables, referred to 
        as static variables
    
-Method
    -> A method is a procedure defined within an object, is used to access to the variables held in the instance and to make some 
        procedures with the data itself.
    
-Message:
    -> One object sends a message to another object requesting some operation or data the idea is that objects are polite to carry out functions by
        sending messages to each other. Is like a procedure call.

-Single or multiple inheritance:
    -> Refer to the number of superclasses from which a class can inherit. **Scala is a SINGLE INHERITANCE SYSTEM**, in which a class can only inherit
        from one class.
