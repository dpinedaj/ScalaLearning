    " The variable \"res0\" does not exist in the notebook. However, we can explicitly bind a name to a value by using the familiar `=` syntax. The declaration `val a = 1 to 10` says that we want to bind the result of `1 to 10` to the name `a`. It is important to note that when we use `val` we're creating an immutable value. This is the reason why we call it a binding rather than assignment. Once we bind a name to a value, that name cannot be re-bound to the a different value in the same scope, even if the types are the same. You can try this out below. Try to bind a different value to `a`. To do this complete change the line that just contains `a` to be `a = 10 to 15` and observe the compiler error."
