    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Lesson Objectives \n",
    "\n",
    "After completing this lesson, you should be able to: \n",
    "\n",
    "* Understand the Pipelines API for Random Forests and Gradient-Boosted Trees\n",
    "* Describe default's Input and Output columns \n",
    "* Perform classification and regression with Random Forests (RFs)\n",
    "* Understand and use Random Forests parameters\n",
    "\n",
    "## Ensemble Method\n",
    "\n",
    "* An Ensemble is a learning algorithm which creates an aggregate model composed of a set of other base models\n",
    "* 'Random Forests' and 'Gradient-Boosted Trees' are ensemble algorithms based on decision trees\n",
    "* Ensemble algorithms are among the top performers for classification and regression problems\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Random Forests (RFs)\n",
    "\n",
    "* Random Forests are ensembles of Decision Trees\n",
    "* One of the most successful machine learning models for classification and regression\n",
    "* Random Forests combine many decision trees in order to reduce the risk of overfitting\n",
    "* The Pipelines API for Random Forests supports both binary and multiclass classification\n",
    "* Supports regression\n",
    "* It also supports continuous and categorical features\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## RF: Basic Algorithm\n",
    "\n",
    "This is a quick description of the basic algorithm of Random Forests:\n",
    "\n",
    "* RF trains a set of decision trees separately while at the same time\n",
    "* RF injects randomness into the training process. This randomness comes from two different sources: \n",
    "  * bootstrapping: subsampling the original data set on each iteration to get a different training set\n",
    "  * considering different random subsets of features to split on at each tree node\n",
    "* Then each tree makes a prediction and the combined predictions from several trees reduces the variance of the predictions and improves the performance on test data\n",
    "  * classification: majority vote - each tree's prediction is counted as a vote for one class and the predicted label is the class with larges number of votes\n",
    "  * regression: average - each tree predicts a real value and the predicted label is equal to the average of all predictions\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Random Forest Parameters I\n",
    "\n",
    "Now let's look at the parameters of Random Forests in Spark.ml\n",
    "\n",
    "I start with the most important parameters: the number of trees and the maximum depth which CAN be tuned to improve performance:\n",
    "* **numTrees**: the total number of trees in the forest. As the number of trees increases:\n",
    "  * the variance of prediction decreases, improving test time accuracy\n",
    "  * training time on the other hand increases roughly linearly with the number of trees\n",
    "* **maxDepth**: the maximum depth of each tree in the forest. As trees get deeper:\n",
    "  * model gets more expressive and powerful \n",
    "  * takes longer to train \n",
    "  * more prone to overfitting\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Random Forest Parameters II\n",
    "\n",
    "The second set of parameters for Random Forests DO NOT require tuning, but they CAN be tuned to speed up training:\n",
    "* **subsamplingRate**: specifies the fraction of the size of the original data set to be used for training each tree in the forest\n",
    "  * default = 1.0\n",
    "  * This means it uses the entire original data set to subsample\n",
    "  * Decreasing this value can speed up training as it uses a smaller sample, but the accuracy of the model may suffer\n",
    "* **featureSubsetStrategy**: specifies the fraction of total number of features to use as candidates for splitting at each tree node\n",
    "  * decreasing this value can speed up training\n",
    "  * if set too low can also impact the performance\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Inputs and Outputs\n",
    "\n",
    "The Inputs taken and the Outputs produced by Random Forests in the Pipelines API are, not surprisingly, exactly the same as Decision Trees."
