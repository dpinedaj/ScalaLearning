Types of hierarchy:
    -> inheritance (single or multiple).
    -> Instantiation: 
        The instantiation hierarchy relates to instances rather than classes and is
        important during the execution of the object.
        
        Types of instance hierarchy:
            -> Part-of relationship
            -> is-a relationship
            for example: class Engine is a part-of class Car
                         class Student is a class Person
