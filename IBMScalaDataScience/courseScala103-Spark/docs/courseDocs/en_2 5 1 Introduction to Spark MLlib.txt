welcome to introduction to spark ml lib after completing this lesson you should
be able to describe what machine learning is and how machines learn you
should be able to explain how machine learning jobs are different than
MapReduce jobs and discuss the key components of sparks ml lib library so
what is machine learning machine learning is any computer program that
improves its performance at some task through experience more precisely
according to Tom Mitchell the chair machine learning department at the
school of computer science at Carnegie Mellon University a computer program is
said to learn from experience II with respect to some class of task T and
performance measure P if its performance at St as measured by P
improves with experiance so how does a machine learn you start with an
assumption about a solution for a given problem you make the machine process
data and verify the assumption you then run the program multiple times with the
same data by updating the assumption as you go you measure improvement and
adjust accordingly you stop running when the assumption is no longer changing the
ability to learn on a large corpus of data is a real win for machine learning
with big data tool sets a wide variety of machine learning applications have
begun to emerge beyond academic applications and even simplistic a male
model shine when they are trained on a huge amount of data so big data is
democratizing machine learning for the general public
machine learning jobs tend to differ from traditional MapReduce jobs in the
following ways their interactive computations they are working through
the data repeatedly they are CPU intensive and not bound by socket or 50
I O and they maintain state between iterations spark emily is sparks machine
learning library
a scalable and easy library for machine learning algorithms it supports popular
machine learning algorithm such as linear regression logistic regression
decision trees and more out of the box the spark ml live is divided into two
broad packages sparked ml lib contains algorithms that work on top of our DVDs
but sparked ml provides a higher level API built on top of data frames for
constructing ml pipelines there are many machine learning libraries out there so
why you Sparky may live it's built on sparks lightweight did powerful API and
sparks open source community is very large and active there are lots of
contributions in improvements from the community on a regular basis and
sparking my lip is one of the most active spark component projects it also
has excellent scalability and performance characteristics
having completed this lesson we should be able to describe what machine
learning is and how machines learn explain how machine learning jobs are
different from MapReduce jobs and discuss the key components of the spark
ml live library
