MLlib and Spark.ml

Spark's machine learning libraries are divided into two packages, MLlib and spark.ml

    MLlib is older, and is built on top of RDDs
    spark.ml is built on top of DataFrames, and can be used to construct ML pipelines
    In cases where MLlib and spark.ml offer equivalent functionality, this course will focus on spark.ml
