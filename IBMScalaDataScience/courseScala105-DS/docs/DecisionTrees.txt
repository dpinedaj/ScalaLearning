DecisionTrees:
    -Popular method for classification and regression
    -Handle categorical features
    -Do NOT require feature scaling
    -They capture non-linearities and feature interactions

MLlib's implementation
    -Support both binary and multi-class classification as well as regression
    -Support continuous and categorical features
    -Partitions data by rows, allowing distributed training

Spark.ML API for Decision Trees:
    -Extended funcionalities
    -Separation of Decision Trees for classification and for regression

Parameters:
    -numClasses (classification)
    -categoricalFeaturesInfo
    -Stopping Criteria
        -Determine when the tree stops building
        -May lead to overfitting
        -Need to be validate on held-out test data
        -Parameters:
            -maxDepth: if increase it get more expressive and maybe higher accuracy
                        but more costly to train and likely to overfit
            -minInstancePerNode
            -minInfoGain
    -Tunable parameters:
        -maxBins
        -maxMemoryInMB
        -subSamplingRate
        -impurity
