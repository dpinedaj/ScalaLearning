The categorical features:
    -Can be processed by his index, which is needed because spark classifiers
     and regressors only work with numerical features

    -Methods:
        -StringIndexer:
            -Converts the string categorical variable into Double Indexers
            -Those indexers store some information about which string represents
        -Reversing the Mapping:
            -When a column is made by a string Indexer, we can restore the string data
             using the IndexToString transformator
        -OneHotEncoding:
            -Generate a sparse vector column, with each dimension of this vector of Booleans
             representing one of the possible values of the original feature
