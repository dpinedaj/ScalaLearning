Normalizer:
    -Is a transformer which transforms a dataset of Vector rows,
    normalizing each vector to have unit norm

Standard Normalizer:
    -Setting a parameter P (2 by default) can normalize the features using
    vectorAssembler

Standard Scaler:
    -A Model which can be fit on a dataset to produce StandardScalerModel
    -Takes two parameters: 
        -withStd: Using standard deviation (default true)
        -withMean: Centers the data with mean before scaling (default false)

    -If the std is 0.0, it returns 0.0 in the vector for that feature

Min Max Scaler:
    -A model which can be fit on a dataset to produce a transformer
    -The transformer can rescale each feature to a specific range (often [0,1])
