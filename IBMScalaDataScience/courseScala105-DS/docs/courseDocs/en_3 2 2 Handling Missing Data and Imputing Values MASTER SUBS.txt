welcome to handling missing data and computing values after completing this
lesson we should be able to drop records and feel missing data according to
different criteria and drop duplicate records data frames have na na method
which provides functionality for working with missing data he returns an instance
of data frame in a functions which implements three types of methods
methods are dropping rows containing inane or null values feel methods for
feeling or replacing in a in or null values and a replacement for replacing
values matching specific case this is an example of a data frame with missing
values first I created data frame with some random values just like I did in
the previous list and an aim at DIA then I have to get some of its values to an
a.m. so I have a data frame with missing values in order to do that I create to
user-defined functions are you da one to turn values over half into and I N
named half to NA and and the other two tone values are over one into a Nhan
named 12 in a if you've never heard of in UDF before diary I just like any
other function the difference being that they take a whole data frame column as
an import perform operations over each value inside column and output the
results as a new data frame column ok now I can form six operations on my data
frame I create two new columns in a in uniform and in a in normal applying my
two UDS to the uniform and normal columns I drop these two columns since I
do not need them anymore and finally I renamed my just created in a in uniform
and in a normal two uniformed in normal respectively
the resulting data frame is then assigned D if in a in this is what da
eff and I am data frame looks like
notice that road with aidid one has missing data in both columns while the
row IDs true 37 and 8th have only one missing data
let's start with the drop function from the data frame in a and functions object
as its name states this function is used for dropping rows containing in a in or
null values according to different criteria there are several different
types of drop available I can drop tries to do not have a minimum number of non
now columns I can drop rows that contain at least one column or all now columns
using respectively
the any or all keywords I can specify a subset of columns of which these
criteria will be computed or I can simply called drop without any arguments
to drop every single row that contains at least one column with a null value
let's stop by dropping rose by using the mean non-null argument in this example I
set the minimum number of columns without null values to be three in
effect this is the same as saying that I want to keep brody's without any null
values on them since I only have three column i hadn I N values on rows with
IDs 1237 and eight so these rosewood dropped and I end up with the data frame
like this now it's dropped Bros easy how argument also specifies subset of
columns over which these criteria is going to be applied in this example I
choose to apply it over the true columns containing values uniform and normal and
I set the how argument all meaning that I only want to drop Bros we're all
columns in this case all specified columns have now values so the only road
we both uniformed and normal columns containing null values is the road I D
one and that is the road dropped leaving me with a data frame like this
here is another example using the house argument the difference being I'm using
any instead of all so in this case if there are any null values on the
specified columns the road is going to be dropped
rose with IDs 1237 an aide had missing data on them so these roads were dropped
and I end up with a data frame like this what if instead of dropping rows
containing null values I wanted to compute these values then I can use the
field function from the data frame in a functions object to replace in a in null
values according to different criteria there are several different types of
feel available I can feel different values for different columns using a map
I can feel the same value for different column and I can feel the same value for
all columns of the same type by the string would double let's start by
feeling old double typed Collins in a data frame with Shearer in the data
frame I created in the beginning of this lesson I had any in values in rows with
IDs 1237 an 80 these values will be filled with viewer since both Collins
would double typed I end up with the data frame like this
replacing num√©rique null values with zero is quite easy but not that useful
and much more common operation is to replace null values in a given column
with a more meaningful value say its corresponding me so let's compute the
main value for the uniform column and use it as a default value Philly null
values in the column here I use the combination of filter group by an egg
functions to get the main of the column uniform first I use filtered to get rid
of all roads with null values in the column uniform then I use group I with
nothing within the parenthesis to group all the field to data and then I apply
the egg functions specifying the main to get the average since results that
contain
within a data frame I applied the first function to turn this into a row and
Oscar the first value from the rug the value is already a double so I don't
need to transform it into any other data types the resulting average value from
the column uniform is . 255 since the table is generated by random numbers
you'll get a different value if you run this example by yourself now for the
easy pot all null values in the column uniform with its mean value I just
called the field function passing map is the argument with a key is the column
name uniform and their values the default value to feel the computed mean
of this column to fit the results on the screen I asked for the top five
resulting rose only the resulting data frame looks like this instead of the NA
ends bro IDs one into now have zero point 255 we managed to feel all null
values in a single column with its mean value but what if I wanted to do the
same for all double typed Commons at once
let's do that in this example through this I thought the names of all double
type columns I want to feel too dificult I could have done it manually but in
this example I only have to drop the first column that is the idea column
next I dropped all rows containing an A and values by specifying an 80 drop the
whole data frame then compute the average for both uniformed and normal
combs with the same group by a nag functions there's only one road lift
which means I think using first and then cast to an array the result is shown in
the value of DA may now have to build a map to be passed as an argument to the
fuel function I seem pleased if the column names with its corresponding
means in custody as a map which I call means map now for the easy part kill all
null values in all double type Collins
its corresponding mean values I called the field function with mains map as an
argument and I end up the data frame like this
night that aidid one and two in the uniform column and IDs one-in-three in
the normal column now computed the average values we have previously
derived another function of the data frame in a functions object is to
replace function is used for replacing values matching specific case it may be
performed every single column or subset of columns of a data frame it also takes
a math argument with a case of the values to be replaced and the values of
the replacing values he we look at a simple example I use the Replace
function to replace all and I in values in the column uniform with the value 0
the result of this operation performed over the DNA in a data frame like this
another useful method is the drop duplicates which is a data frame method
as its name states it is used to remove duplicate rows but it's possible to
specify a subset of columns to check for duplicates instead of checking the role
as a whole
to illustrate this method I append to more rose to the DFA in a and data frame
containing identical values for both uniformed and normal columns but with
different I days the resulting data frame named DFG pockets like this
then I J
least columns I wish to remove duplicates on in this case the column
IDs irrelevant since I create and write a column names uniform and normal by
dropping the name of the first column I D then I called the drop duplicates
method by specifying the column names array and it drops the road with idea 11
which was identical to the road with aidid 10
having completed this lesson you should be able to drop records in film missing
data according to different criteria and drop duplicate records
