welcome to predicting grant applications and introduction after completing this
model we will have the ability to use all of the parallel processing power of
the spark cluster two feet and evaluate machine learning models these can be
dramatically faster than working on a laptop or even a large multi core server
contrary to what we did in the other modules in this module will not repeat
the script we've run in previous lessons after completing this lesson we should
be able to understand in a general way the data available in the grant
application data sit appreciate the problem being solved and proposed some
features that might be good predictors the dataset will be looking at contains
8708 grant applications from the University of Melbourne 3992 of which
was successful there was seventeen thousand five hundred and ninety-four
researchers involved in those applications and the data is available
on capital L goal is to understand what features contribute to a successful
grant application and we would like to build a model beacon successfully
predict whether an application will be successful or not here is some of the
grant data that's available in the dataset now the original dataset from
cattle has additional information but we've dropped several columns in order
to simplify this example
some of the grant date of the way looking at includes a grant application
I D which is encoded as an integer the grant status this is whether or not the
grant application was successful or not the contract value band this is the
amount of the grant bucket ice tea into ranges and this is encoded as a strain
and grant category code also encoded as a string it is the categorization of the
sponsor for example Australian competitive grants Cooperative Research
Centre industry etc
now we have some . about researches so this includes the researchers role in
the proposed research their date of birth day department number and whether
they have a PhD or not boorda her about researches that we looking at includes
the number of successful grounds the number of unsuccessful grants and the
number of articles published in journals of various quality a to being the most
prestigious and say the least and here is the basic setup night that uses
running Windows will have to download the data set to a local file in some
other way because the shell command W get might work for you
the original data from the university as distributed by candle is quite messy so
we've cleaned the data and join the data about researchers and grants together
into a single table we using this box here to a package from data breaks to
load these tab separated csv file in case you've downloaded the file
elsewhere please change the load path to the location on your local machine and
if you're trying this out on a cluster instead of a local machine movies file
to html his and he was showing some of the columns from the dataset these
include the grant application I D
the role the investigative place whether they have a PhD or not the number of
successful grounds the number of unsuccessful grants which journals
they've published in and the grad status as some of the grant applications like
number three we have many rows of data in this data frame this is because there
are many researches collaborating on this one grant application there are
also many cases where the data is missing before we continue to the next
lesson
let's have the think about a few things first we want to include features that
are a good predictor each grant we also want to create preaches about grounds
using the data about researchers and we would like to understand which values in
the dataset might make good predictors
having completed this lesson we should be able to understand in a general way
the data are available in the grant application dataset appreciate the
problem being solved and proposed some features that might be good predictors
