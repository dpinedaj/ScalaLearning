welcome to feature vectors
after completing this lesson we should be able to understand how feature
vectors feeding to the API's
box in mail leap and Spa Kimmel Live briefs it simple feature vectors and
extract specific dimensions from feature vectors Emily B is dependent on the IDD
API which is best used from Scala for run-time performance reasons Python in
our performance when using our DVDs can be anywhere from three to 10 times lower
back email is a new email library implementation that leverages data
frames data frames homogenized the runtime performance between Scylla
Python and I but at the expense of a less powerful API but is also not well
typed so you feel this way we passed ring bell using two functions to
represent what we want to do but if you misspelled one of these streams you only
find out at runtime so that can be quite painful as a data scientist using Scala
we have to make choices about which aP I we will use based upon the power of
either implementation the type safety and correctness we desire and the
runtime performance associated with it
there is a new API code data sets in spark version 1.6 but we won't cover
them in this course the models in ML lead a designed to work with IDD label
point objects which associates labels with feature vectors on the other hand
the models with sparking a melee designed to work with data frames and
basics Pachelbel data frame will by default have two columns labeled column
and features column let's have a look at creating featured that does using spock
email the output of our extract transform load process
ETL process may be a data frame in this example we have a data frame with full
color change user session count revenue arising from those sessions and recency
or time elapsed since our last login
we would like to see if we can prediction using the three other
variables in a data frame
here is the code to generate the example data frame
in order to use the model estimated since pocket male roommate to combine
your features into one victim you can do this with a victory simpler to use of
victories same blow specify the columns you want to gather together and the name
of the victim Kalam you want to have created here I've included the session
count total revenue and the number of days since the last login or recency
into the features victim you can also use Invictus license to extract data
from each victim in this example have chosen to keep the first two columns of
the feature vectors
having completed this lesson we should now be able to understand how feature
vectors feet into the API's for Spock Sam Elliott and Spa kemal libraries the
symbol feature vectors and extract specific dimensions from feature victors
