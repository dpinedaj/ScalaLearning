welcome to a formula
after completing this lesson you should be able to understand why often Mueller
exists understand a formal invitation understand the transformations a formula
produces only new models and use a formula on a real-world example in
modeling we often define a variable as a function of other variables or
predictors the pseudocode for DS is very close to more traditional math notation
it could be that a variable Y equals the combination of several other variables
variable A&B all the way to variable fee
the problem is it is entirely accurate to use the equal simple because we are
generally working with variables that are random and it really only makes
sense but two random variables to be equal in distribution so we used the TLD
sign to denied that one variable is composed of others ie that one variable
who had the distributional qualities of the particular composition of the others
the at symbol represents the inclusion of a variable in a model
this table
shows some of the ways variables can be combined in the interaction term is used
when the combination of two or more variables contribute to the outcome of
the third for example the joint effect of inhaling asbestos and smoking is
higher than the sum of both of those effects separately
in we don't tend to go down to the abstraction level so we aren't concerned
much with the internals of this system unlike with spark an example is that the
string input columns will automatically be one hot encoded
Lighthouse Park actually fits two models for the two levels of the categorical
variables that a one hot encoded when we are dealing with multiple categorical
variables but Sparky's doing his defeat multiple models one for each condition
this is the same dataset be downloaded in the lesson on using principal
component analysis the feature engineering first we use the colon DEP
to add the dependency for the spock CSV library so we can use it we then create
the sequel context so we can access data frames and import the implicit it's
required for automatic data type conversions when we load the data we
then read the CSV data as we did in early adolescence specifying the format
the delimiter character whether or not there is a header row and whether or not
to infer the schema
we will use the crimes to date a frame from the previous list and 3.3 point
four principal component analysis feature engineering if you arrived at
this video without viewing that one first
you may want to go back and do so before viewing this one
we provide the formula as to how to calculate what we want from each field
and provide the features and label column names next we fit the formula and
transform the results when we select the data by column name here the results
than what we've seen is that a formula is a very handy shorthand to write quite
elaborate models it started in the Outworld used only on linear models but
over time on the models for example random forests started using formula
notation to specify models a formula simplifies the creation of machine
learning pipelines by providing a concise way of expressing complex
feature transformations
having completed this lesson we should now be able to understand the off
formulate interface to model feeding and fit a model using the formula interface
