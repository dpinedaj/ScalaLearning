welcome to evaluation
after completing this lesson you should be able to evaluate binary
classification algorithm using the area under the receiver operating
characteristic curve or the rock evaluate multi-class classification and
regression algorithms using several metrics and evaluate logistic and linear
regression algorithm using summaries up to training a model and making
predictions for the test data it is time to evaluate the model and evaluate is a
class that computes metrics from the predictions there are three types of
evaluate is available the binary classification evaluated as the
multi-class classification evaluated and regression evaluators if you haven't
downloaded the data fit from the previous lesson here is the link in the
script to download it to your temporary folder and loaded into spark now we look
at an example of binary classification using logistic regression test I create
a new instance of the logistic regression and said its premise the
maximum number of iterations the regularization and elastic net premise
then I call the fifth method to produce a trained model which I named log model
that is that I'm still using the training data from the original data
frame five randomly selected in the beginning of this entire module I can
inspect the whites
coefficients and the intercept of the trained model using the corresponding
attributes in a model instance let's start with the binary classification
evaluate oh as its name states it is used to evaluate binary classifies it
expects to input columns the Royal prediction column and the label column
the only supported metric
area under the ROC curve this is an example of a binary classification
evaluate oh I'm going to build upon the logistic regression model from the
previous lesson and evaluate its predictions
Thursday I called the transform method on the test data to get a data frame
with the predictions which I named predictions log in I create a new
instance of a binary classification evaluate oh and set the corresponding
columns as inputs and the metric name to the army available metric area under ROC
now I can call the evaluated evaluate method on the predictions made by the
logistic regression to get its area under the ROC curve which happens to be
in this example a perfect 10 often there are more than two categories you can
classify an item into the multi-class classification evaluate oh he's an
evaluative for multi-class classification problems it also expects
to employ columns prediction and label it supports five different metrics the F
school the default meant trick precision recall and it's weighted versions waited
precision and waited recall to show what a multi-class classification evaluated
can do we will need a model that can do more than two categories the Random
Forest classifier we calculated before we do we will need to prepare the
pipeline for that model this is the exact script we have running previous
sessions to set up pipelines for random forests and gradient boosting treat all
the rest is exactly the same as before calling the feet method to get a model
and calling the transform method to make predictions the predictions and then
returned in the prediction RFC data frame now an example of a multi-class
evaluate oh this example I can evaluate any of the multi-class classifiers I
have trained so far and I choose to evaluate the predictions made by the
Random Forest classifier which I previously assigned to the prediction
see data frame the true labels of the tests it we're in the index label column
and the predictions made by the model wherein its prediction column so I
create a new instance of a multi classification of value 80 and set the
corresponding columns imports also I said the metric to be precision instead
of the default if school now I can call the evaluated evaluate method on the
predictions made by the Random Forest classifier to get the estimated
precision which is 96.6% or put in another way
a 3.3% test era the regression evaluator is an evaluative aggression problems it
also expects to import columns prediction and label it supports four
different metrics root mean squared error which is the default metric main
square Deira ask Wade which is the coefficient of determination and mean
absolute era who used the previous regression in a previous lists and in
random forest if you come to this listen directly and don't have the context he
is the code that produces the predictions we will evaluate now for an
example of a regression evaluate 0 for this example I can evaluate any of the
regreses I've trained so far and I choose to evaluate the predictions made
by the random forest regresar which I've previously assigned to the predictions
are if they to frame the true labels of the tests it when its label column and
the predictions made by the model wherein its prediction column so I
create a new instance of regression evaluate oh and sit the corresponding
columns imports also I sit the metric to be the root-mean-square era now I can
call the evaluated evaluate method on the predictions made by the random
forest regresa to get the root mean squared error on the test data which is
approximately zero point 16
in less than three point for point fool I introduced summaries for both logistic
regression and linear regression models they were accessible through this
summary attribute of the model and contained useful information regarding
the training crisis
the majestic regression model summary is an instance of logistic regression
training summary which can be casted as a binary logistic regression summary
fields summary can be used for model evaluation it supports six different
metrics the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve the F
measure by threshold it data frame with two fields at threshold and its
corresponding if measure PR the precision recall curve also a data frame
with two fields recall and precision precision by threshold a data frame with
two fields at threshold and its corresponding precision recall by
threshold a data frame with two fields at threshold and its corresponding
recall and rock the receiver operating characteristic curve data frame with two
fields false-positive tried and true positive rate now for a simple example
of a binary logistic regression summary again I'm going to build up the logistic
regression model from the previous lesson and get it summary which I named
training summary Ella next I cast an instance of binary logistic regression
summary which I named finery summary then I can get any of the supported
metrics by accessing its corresponding methods so I get the area under the ROC
curve which is . 99 I can also get the F measure by threshold as shown in the
resulting data frame and yes this is a close to perfect model and it's very
unlikely that you'll get such a perfect fit with data in reality then I can
obtain the maximum if measure applying the aggregate method on these data frame
as seen in an early lesson in this case the maximum if misha is . 988 now I can
get the corresponding threshold using a we're conditioned on the data frame
taking its head row and casting it to a double alternatively I can get either
the precision by threshold
the recall by threshold data frames has shown in this light finally I can get
the ROC curve as the data frame with false positive rates and true positive
rate in its columns linear regression models also have summary they can be
easily accessed through the summary attribute the linear regression model
and like the logistic regression there is no need for casting it to another
class it also supports six different metrics explained variance main absolute
era LDL one normal loss mean square Deira a squid also the coefficient of
determination the residuals which is the difference between the actual and
predicted values and the root mean square Deira now I'm going to build up
on the linear regression model from the previous list in and get it summary
which I named training summary lol its game I can simply get any of the
supported matrix by accessing its corresponding methods so I show the
results for the explained variance mean absolute era mean squared error and for
the coefficient of determination I can also get the residuals as the data frame
and finally the root mean squared error for the model is also available
having completed this lesson you should now be able to evaluate binary
classification algorithm using the area under the ROC curve evaluate multi-class
classification and regression algorithms using simple metrics and evaluate
logistic and linear regression algorithms using summaries
