    -The models in MLlib are designed to work with RDD[LabeledPoint] objects, 
    which associates labels with feature vectors

        -The models in spark.ml are designed to work with DataFrames
        -A basic spark.ml DataFrame will (by default) have two columns:
            -a label column (default name: "label")
            -a feature column (default name: "features")
        -To create a feature vector we can use the VectorAssembler Transformer
            passing to it the features and output all in the same column
