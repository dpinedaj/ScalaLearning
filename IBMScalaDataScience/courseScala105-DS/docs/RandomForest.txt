Random Forests:
    -Ensembles of Decision Trees
    -Can perform Classification and Regression analysis
    -Combines many decision trees in order to reduce the risk of overfitting
    -Support continuous and categorical features
    -Parameters:

        -numTrees: The total number of trees in the forest
            -Require tuning
            -As the number increases the variance decreases
            -training time increase
        -maxDepth: maximum depth of each tree in the forest
            -Require tuning
            -Takes longer to train
            -More prone to overfitting

        -subsamplingRate: fraction of the size of the original data set to use 
            for training in each tree
            -default = 1.0
        -featureSubsetStrategy: fraction of total number of features to use as
            candidates for splitting at each tree node
            -decreasing this can speed up training
            -if set too low can also impact the performance
