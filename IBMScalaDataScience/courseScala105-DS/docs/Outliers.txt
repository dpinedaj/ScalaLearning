Mahalanobis Distance:
    -Multi-dimensional generalization of measuring how
    many standard deviations a point is away from the mean
    -Measured along each Principal Component axis
    -Unitless and scale-invariant
    -Takes into account the correlations of the dataset
    -Used to detect outliers

    --> Is important to scale the features before applying the process

    -->It takes the inverse matrix of the correlation matrix to perform the udf
    
    --> The udf to perform mahalabobis convert a vector to a linalg Vector with the formula:
            vB.t * invCorre * vB
