Local Matrices:
    -Natural extension of Vectors
    -Row and column indices are 0-based integers and values are doubles
    -Local matrices are stored on a single machine
    -Can be dense or sparse
    -Are filled in column major order

    Dense Matrices:
        -A "reshaped" dense Vector
        -First two arguments specify dimensions of the matrix
        -Entries are stored in a single double array

    Sparse Matrices:
        -Compressed Sparse Column Matrices


Distributued Matrices:
    -They are stored in one or more RDDs
    -Three types:
        -RowMatrix:
            -It has no meaningful row indices, being only a collection of feature vectores
            -Backed by an RDD of its rows, where eachh row is a local vector
            -Assumes the number of columns is small enough to be stored in a local vector
            -Each row is a local vector
            - Can be Easily created from an 'RDD[Vector]'

        -IndexedRowMatrix:
            -Similar to RowMatrix but it has row indices, 
                which can be used for identifying rows and executing joins.
            -Backed by an RDD of indexed rows,
                where each row is a tuple containing an index(long-typed) and a local Vector
            -Easily created from an 'RDD[IndexedRow]'
            -Can be converted to RowMatrix calling 'toRowMatrix()'

        -CoordinateMatrix:
            -Should be used only when dimensions are huge and matrix is very sparse.
            -Backed by an 'RDD[MatrixEntry]', where each entry
                is a tuple (i: Long, j: Long, value: Double) where:
                    -i is the row index
                    -j is the column index
                    -value is the entry value

    -Conversions may require an expensive global shuffle
