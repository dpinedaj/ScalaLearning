Transformers:
    -Algorithm which can transform one DataFrame into another DataFrame
    -Abstraction that includes feature transformers ande laearned models.
    -Implements a method "transform()",  which converts one DataFrame into another,
        generally by appending one or more columns.
    -Input and output columns set with "setInputCol" and "setOutputCol" methods
    -Examples:
        -Read one or more columns and map them into a new column of feature vectors
        -Read a column containing feature vectors and make prediction for each vector


    Natural Language processing transformers:
        -HashingTF          - Hash text/data to vector
        -IDF                - Scale features by inverse document frequency
        -RegexTokenizer     - Tokenize text using regular expressions
        -RegexTokenizer     - Tokenize text on whitespace
        -Word2Vec           - Learn vector representation of words


Estimators:
    -Algorithm which can be fit on a DataFrame to produce a Transformer
    -Abstracts the concept of a learning algorithm or any algorithm that fits or trains on data
    -Implements a method "fit()", which accepts a DataFrame and produces a model,
        which is a Transformer
    -Example: LogisticRegression
        -It is a learning algorithm and therefore an Estimator
        -By calling the method "fit()" to train the logistic regression,
            a Model is returned

Parameters:
    -Transformers and Estimators use a uniform API for specifying Parameters
    -A ParamMap is a set of (parameter, value) pairs
    -Parameters are specific to a given instance
    -There are two main ways to pass parameters to an algorithm:
        -Setting parameters for an instance using an appropriate method, for instance,
            "setMaxIter(10)"
        -Passing a ParamMap to "fit()" or "transform()", for instance, "ParamMap(lr1.MaxIiter -> 10, lr2.MaxIter ->20)
            -In this case, the parameter "MaxIter" is beign specified to two different instances of models lr1 and lr2

Vector Assembler

    -Transformer that combines a given list of columns into a single vector column
    -Useful for combining raw features and features generated by other transformers into a single feature vector
    -Accepts the following input column types:
        -all numeric types
        -boolean
        -vector
