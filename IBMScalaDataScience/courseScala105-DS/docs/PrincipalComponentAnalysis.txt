PCA:
    -Dimension reduction technique, is a unsupervised machine learning model
    -The principal component (PC) is defined as the linear combination of the
     predictors that captures the most variability of all possible linear combinations.
     then, subsequent PCs are derived such thaht these linear combinations capture
     the most remaining variability while also beign uncorrelated with all previous
     PCs.

Feature Engineering with PCA:
    -The basic idea es generate a smaller set of variables that capture most of the
     information in the original variables

Pros:
    -Interpretability
    -Create components that are uncorrelated
    -Helps avoiding the curse of dimensionality
    -Improves performance on further modeling

Cons:
    -The computational effort depends on the number of variables and records
    -PCA seeks lineal combinations, so will summarize predictors that retain most
     of the variation in the data

How many principal components to use:
    -Depends of each case, is a heuristic practice
    -Can be used the elbow on the graphs

Tip:
    -Always center and scale the predictors prior to perform PCA
