There are some "predefined" or synthetic methods to make easier the work, some:
    -equals()
        -Compares whether an instance of the class is the exact same
            instance

    -hashCode()
        -This method is required for any class that you might
        want to put a hashed collection, such a HashMap or a HashSet
            -> a hashed collection is a collection with a tag or "hash" to 
                efficiently identify the values, it can be an integer identifier
                or something else.
    -toString()
        -This method is used to prints out a virtual representation of the instance location
            in memory
        -The synthetic "toString()" provided by Scala's case class shows the values inside of the class
        -You can override this to make it even better
    -copy()
        -Allows you to remain immutable and use "snapshots" of case classes when state needs to change
